This is further supported by the discharge medications, which include Pioglitazone, a medication commonly used to manage type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe patient underwent a **right carotid endarterectomy** as indicated in the \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section of the clinical note. This procedure involves the surgical removal of plaque from the carotid artery, which is located in the neck. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-9 procedure code for this intervention is |38.12|, which specifically denotes endarterectomy of other vessels of the head and neck.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, which is directly relevant to the target ICD code |272.4| for other and unspecified hyperlipidemia. This condition is also reflected in the patient's medication list, where they are prescribed Atorvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent, further supporting the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates that they were prescribed aspirin 81 mg daily both upon admission and at discharge, which suggests ongoing use of aspirin for therapeutic purposes. This long-term use of aspirin is consistent with the ICD-9 code |V58.66|, which denotes an encounter for the long-term (current) use of aspirin.\n\nThe patient's clinical note describes a history of severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, which led to transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and necessitated an urgent carotid endarterectomy. The discharge diagnosis explicitly states \"Right Carotid Artery Stenosis,\" and there is no mention of cerebral infarction. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-9 code is |433.10|, which corresponds to occlusion and stenosis of the carotid artery without mention of cerebral infarction.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes hypertension, which is documented in both the \"History of Present Illness\" and \"Past Medical History\" sections of the clinical note. This consistent mention of hypertension, without specifying a particular type or severity, supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |401.9| for unspecified essential hypertension.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |250.00||38.12||272.4||V58.66||433.10||401.9|.",

Additionally, a subsequent CT scan showed a perihepatic fluid collection and hypodensity within the liver, suggesting a ruptured hepatic abscess. These findings, particularly the presence of a hepatic cyst, align with the diagnosis of |573.8|, which encompasses other specified disorders of the liver.\n\nThe patient's clinical note describes a history of fever of unknown origin and imaging findings consistent with a hepatic cyst, which was initially concerning for a hepatic cystadenoma or abscess. However, upon further evaluation by interventional radiology, the findings were attributed to inflammation rather than a drainable fluid collection. This scenario aligns with the ICD code |E879.8|, as the imaging procedure (CT scan) led to a diagnostic uncertainty and potential mismanagement, without evidence of immediate adverse events during the procedure itself.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of a chronic cough, which is described as being related to \"seasonal bronchitis.\" This chronic condition is consistently noted throughout the history and physical exam, indicating a persistent issue that aligns with the diagnosis of |496|: chronic airway obstruction, not elsewhere classified.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of diverticulitis with abscess leading to hemicolectomy and sigmoid resection, which indicates the surgical removal of part of the large intestine. This surgical intervention results in the acquired absence of a portion of the large intestine, aligning with the ICD code |V45.72|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of chronic cough, which is often associated with asthma. However, there is no specific mention of asthma symptoms or diagnosis in the note. Therefore, while the chronic cough suggests a potential underlying respiratory condition, the note does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively infer |493.90| (asthma, unspecified type, without mention of status asthmaticus).\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient with a hepatic cyst, which was identified on ultrasound and confirmed by CT showing a perihepatic fluid collection and hypodensity within the liver, suggesting a ruptured hepatic abscess. While the primary diagnosis is |572.8| (other specified disorders of liver), the presence of a hepatic cyst, even if not malignant, falls under the broader category of specified liver disorders. Therefore, the target ICD code |155.0| (malignant neoplasm of liver, primary) is not directly supported by the evidence provided in the clinical note, as there is no indication of malignancy or primary liver cancer.\n\nThe patient's clinical note describes a history of fever of unknown origin and imaging findings consistent with a hepatic cyst, which raised concerns for a potential hepatic abscess. Although the CT scan suggested a ruptured hepatic abscess, interventional radiology determined that the findings were due to inflammation rather than a drainable fluid collection. Despite this, the initial suspicion and imaging findings align with the diagnosis of |572.0| (abscess of liver).\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |573.8||E879.8||496||V45.72||493.90||155.0||572.0|.",

The clinical note mentions that she does not tolerate CPAP, indicating ongoing issues with OSA management. This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |327.23| for obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nThe patient has a documented history of |311| (depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified), as indicated in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. Additionally, the patient is prescribed citalopram, an antidepressant, which further supports the diagnosis of |311|. The continuation of citalopram upon discharge also reinforces the ongoing management of this condition.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a mention of \"Osteoarthritis s/p left total hip replacement,\" which indicates that the patient has undergone a total hip replacement procedure. This aligns with the ICD-9 code |V43.64|, which specifically denotes a hip joint replaced by other means. Therefore, the presence of this past surgical history justifies the assignment of the code |V43.64|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she has a history of dementia, which is listed under her past medical history. This information directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |294.20|, indicating dementia, unspecified, without behavioral disturbance.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypothyroidism, as noted in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. This condition is managed with levothyroxine sodium 75 mcg PO daily, which is continued both on admission and at discharge. Therefore, the diagnosis of |244.9| (unspecified hypothyroidism) is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions \"Down's syndrome\" multiple times, including in the \"Complaint\" section where it states, \"___ with Down's syndrome, multiple pneumonias, and severe OSA,\" and again in the \"Past Medical History\" section. This consistent documentation of Down's syndrome directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |758.0|.\n\nThe patient has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea, which were exacerbated by post-operative sedation and analgesia, leading to hypoxemia and desaturation during sleep. This condition necessitated the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to manage her respiratory status, thus supporting the diagnosis of |780.57|: unspecified sleep apnea.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a mention of \"mitral valve prolapse,\" which is a specific type of mitral valve disorder. This condition is directly coded as |424.0|, reflecting the presence of a mitral valve disorder. Therefore, the target ICD code |424.0| is appropriately associated with the patient's clinical note.\n\nThe patient has a history of osteoarthritis and a past medical history that includes a left total hip replacement, which suggests underlying bone density issues. Additionally, the discharge medications include calcium and vitamin D supplements, indicating a focus on maintaining bone health. These factors collectively suggest a potential underlying disorder of bone and cartilage, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |733.90|.\n\nThe patient underwent a **laparoscopic right colectomy** for a cecal mass, as detailed in the \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section and confirmed in the \"History of Present Illness.\" This surgical procedure is accurately coded as |17.33|, which corresponds to a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes hyperlipidemia (HLD), which is documented in the clinical note. This condition is consistent with the ICD-9 code |272.4|, which covers other and unspecified hyperlipidemia. The patient is also on simvastatin, a medication used to manage hyperlipidemia, further supporting the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions \"post-operative atelectasis,\" which is a form of pulmonary collapse (|518.0|). This condition is evident from the description of the patient's hypoxia and respiratory issues post-surgery, including desaturations and the need for continuous oxygen monitoring and bipap support. The presence of atelectasis is further supported by the mention of \"mild fluid overload\" and the need for continuous oxygen therapy until sedation weaned off.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (RLL infiltrate on CXR) and treated for it before the planned right hemicolectomy. This indicates a recent episode of pneumonia, which aligns with the ICD code |V12.61| for recurrent pneumonia.\n\nThe patient underwent a laparoscopic right colectomy for a cecal mass, which was biopsied and revealed an adenoma, a benign neoplasm. This finding is consistent with the diagnosis of a benign neoplasm of the colon, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |211.3|.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |327.23||311||V43.64||294.20||244.9||758.0||780.57||424.0||733.90||17.33||272.4||518.0||V12.61||211.3|.",

The clinical note mentions that her pain was managed with Ultram and Dilaudid, and she was weaned off narcotics to facilitate her transition to a rehabilitation facility. These details support the diagnosis of |338.29|, indicating other chronic pain.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates a history of alcohol abuse and recent alcohol use, with a reported last drink on a specific date and an ethanol level of 112 on admission. Additionally, the patient was monitored for alcohol withdrawal symptoms using the CIWA scale and was eventually tapered off sedatives, suggesting a process of alcohol detoxification. These findings support the assignment of the ICD code |94.62| for alcohol detoxification.\n\nThe patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and abdominal pain, which are consistent with complications of advanced liver disease. The physical exam reveals scleral icterus and a distended abdomen with tenderness, and laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. These findings, combined with the patient's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of ascites noted in the abdominal ultrasound, strongly suggest the development of |572.3| (portal hypertension).\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a history of uterine and cervical cancer, specifically noting that she had a hysterectomy in the past. This indicates a personal history of malignant neoplasm of the cervix uteri, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |V10.41|.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic pain, as mentioned in the Past Medical History section, and continues to report ongoing abdominal pain throughout her hospital stay, which is documented in the History of Present Illness and Physical Exam sections. This consistent reporting of abdominal pain, along with the use of pain medications such as Percocet and Dilaudid, supports the diagnosis of |338.19|: other acute pain.\n\nThe patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent consumption of alcohol, coupled with elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) and a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, strongly supports the assignment of the ICD code |571.1| for acute alcoholic hepatitis. The clinical course, including the decision to start prednisone for suspected alcoholic hepatitis and the subsequent improvement in liver function tests, further confirms this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and describes symptoms such as increased abdominal girth and tenderness, along with laboratory findings of hypoalbuminemia and ascites on imaging. These findings are consistent with the presence of ascites, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |789.59| for other ascites.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis related to alcohol abuse, and during this admission, she presented with elevated lipase levels, indicating acute exacerbation of her chronic condition. The CT abdomen showed jejunal fold thickening, which, while not definitive, suggests ongoing pancreatic inflammation. These findings support the diagnosis of |577.0| acute pancreatitis.\n\nThe patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent consumption of alcohol, along with her presentation of elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) and jaundice, suggests a diagnosis of |571.2| (alcoholic cirrhosis of liver). The clinical course, including the need for prednisone to manage her liver function tests and the presence of complications such as ascites and portal hypertension, further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient has a history of asthma, which is mentioned in the Past Medical History section. During the hospital stay, the patient reported using her inhalers frequently, indicating ongoing respiratory symptoms. These findings support the diagnosis of |493.90|, asthma, unspecified type, without mention of status asthmaticus.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness and past medical history clearly indicate a diagnosis of |303.91|, as she has a documented history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic cirrhosis, with recent alcohol consumption and a high EtOH level on admission. The clinical note also mentions her desire to enter an inpatient alcohol rehab facility, further supporting the diagnosis of continuous drinking behavior.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with complications including esophageal varices, which are often associated with portal hypertension. Although there is no explicit mention of active bleeding, the presence of esophageal varices in the context of her liver disease supports the diagnosis of |456.21|, esophageal varices in diseases classified elsewhere, without mention of bleeding.\n\nThe patient presented with a right pleural effusion, as evidenced by the CXR showing a \"slight increased lg R effusion/RLL opacity\" and the subsequent thoracentesis that removed 2.1 liters of fluid. This finding, along with the clinical presentation of shortness of breath and the physical exam noting decreased breath sounds on the right side, supports the diagnosis of |511.9|: unspecified pleural effusion.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a urinary tract infection (UTI) that was initially treated with levofloxacin in the ED and later switched to ciprofloxacin. A urinalysis performed during the hospital stay showed persistent infection, leading to the initiation of Bactrim DS. These findings and treatments are consistent with a diagnosis of |599.0|, indicating a urinary tract infection, site not specified.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she was hypomagnesemic on admission, with magnesium levels requiring repletion as needed. This indicates a disorder of magnesium metabolism, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |275.2|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she was hypokalemic on admission, with potassium levels noted to be low. This is evident from the lab results showing a potassium level of 3.6 mmol/L, which is below the normal range. Therefore, the diagnosis of |276.8| (hypokalemia) is supported by the clinical documentation.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she was hypokalemic and hypomagnesemic on admission, and her phosphate levels were slightly low on a specific date, necessitating the administration of Neutraphos. These findings indicate disorders of phosphorus metabolism, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |275.3|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates a significant decrease in platelet count, with platelets ranging in the 60s to 70s, which is below the normal range, suggesting |287.5| (thrombocytopenia, unspecified). This is further supported by the mention of thrombocytopenia being a known complication of her underlying conditions, including alcoholic cirrhosis and chronic pancreatitis.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates a history of chronic anemia, likely macrocytic in nature due to alcohol use, as evidenced by the mention of \"macrocytic anemia: chronic at baseline, likely macrocytic due to etoh use.\" Additionally, the patient was given B12 and folate supplementation, although upon further inspection, she was not B12 deficient. These findings support the diagnosis of |281.9|, unspecified deficiency anemia.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic cirrhosis, with elevated liver enzymes and jaundice, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. The note also describes the patient's hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, which are common complications of advanced liver disease. These findings, combined with the patient's need for prednisone to manage her liver function tests, strongly suggest the presence of hepatic encephalopathy, which can progress to |572.2| (hepatic coma) in severe cases.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she had a sodium level as low as 125, which improved to 131 by the time of discharge. This significant hyponatremia, documented throughout the hospital stay, directly supports the assignment of the ICD code |276.1| for hyposmolality and/or hyponatremia.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a hysterectomy, which indicates the surgical removal of both the uterus and cervix. This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V88.01|, which denotes acquired absence of both cervix and uterus.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |34.91||338.29||94.62||572.3||V10.41||338.19||571.1||789.59||577.0||571.2||493.90||303.91||456.21||511.9||599.0||275.2||276.8||275.3||287.5||281.9||572.2||276.1||V88.01|.",

Specifically, the note mentions that the patient \"was found collapse in the chair by the PCT\" with a pulse of 20, and subsequently arrested, requiring resuscitation efforts including epinephrine and atropine. Later, he was found in asystole and then progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA), both of which are forms of cardiac arrest, supporting the diagnosis of |427.5|.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient who underwent a **Right hepatic lobectomy** for a 9 cm liver mass, which is consistent with the procedure code |50.3|. The note explicitly states that the surgery was performed due to a large mass in the right lobe of the liver, and the operative findings confirmed the presence of a significant mass in segments 6, 7, and 8, leading to the decision to perform the lobectomy. This directly supports the assignment of the ICD code |50.3|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |250.00|, type II diabetes mellitus, which is mentioned alongside other chronic conditions such as hypertension and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. This diagnosis is further supported by the presence of metformin and pioglitazone in the patient\u2019s medication list, indicating ongoing management of diabetes without specific mention of complications or uncontrolled status. Therefore, the target ICD code |250.00| is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes degenerative joint disease (DJD), which is synonymous with osteoarthrosis. This condition is mentioned without specifying the affected site, aligning with the diagnosis of |715.90|, osteoarthrosis, unspecified whether generalized or localized, involving an unspecified site.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness clearly indicates a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, as evidenced by the presence of a 14 x 11 x 10 cm mass in the right lobe of the liver, which is consistent with |155.0| (malignant neoplasm of liver, primary). The surgical procedure of right hepatic lobectomy further confirms the presence of a primary liver malignancy, supporting the assignment of |155.0|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |401.9| (unspecified essential hypertension), which is explicitly listed among his comorbidities. This diagnosis is further supported by the presence of antihypertensive medications such as nifedipine CR and metoprolol in his medication list, indicating ongoing management of hypertension. Therefore, the target ICD code |401.9| is appropriately associated with this patient's clinical note.\n\nThe patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and the presence of a liver mass, as documented in the clinical note, strongly suggest a history of chronic alcohol abuse. This is further supported by the past medical history, which explicitly lists \"EtOH-induced cirrhosis.\" Therefore, the target ICD code |V11.3| (personal history of alcoholism) can be reasonably inferred from the provided information.\n\nThe patient experienced a cardeopulmonary arrest, as documented in the discharge diagnosis, which led to his death. The clinical note details multiple instances of hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, severe renal perfusion issues, and a rising lactate level, all of which are consistent with acute respiratory failure |518.81|, especially in the context of his critical condition and ultimate demise.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient was intubated during his postoperative course, specifically noting \"NG was placed, code was managed according to ACLS protocol, rhythm was restored. Pt was transferred to SICU.\" This indicates the insertion of an endotracheal tube, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |96.04|.\n\nThe patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, mentioned in both the \"History of Present Illness\" and \"Past Medical History\" sections, directly supports the diagnosis of |571.2| (alcoholic cirrhosis of liver). Additionally, the physical exam notes significant scleral edema, which is a common sign of advanced liver disease, further reinforcing this diagnosis.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient was intubated and required mechanical ventilation, as evidenced by the statement \"Pt was intubated then transferred to SICU\" and the use of continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) during his postoperative course. This indicates the administration of continuous mechanical ventilation, which aligns with the ICD code |96.71| for continuous mechanical ventilation for less than 96 consecutive hours.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates a significant decline in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, with Hgb dropping to 8.5 and Hct to 26.6, suggesting acute blood loss. This is further supported by the need for a blood transfusion on postoperative day 1 and the subsequent drop in Hct to 24, indicating ongoing hemorrhage or blood loss. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of |285.1| acute posthemorrhagic anemia.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |571.8|, other chronic nonalcoholic liver disease, as evidenced by the documented history of alcoholic cirrhosis and fatty liver, which are forms of chronic liver disease. The presence of a liver mass and abnormal liver function tests further supports the diagnosis of chronic liver disease, aligning with the ICD code |571.8|.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |427.5||50.3||250.00||715.90||155.0||401.9||V11.3||518.81||96.04||571.2||96.71||285.1||571.8|.",

During the hospital stay, the patient was restarted on prednisone 5 mg daily, indicating ongoing long-term use of steroids. This supports the assignment of the ICD code |V58.65| for an encounter related to the long-term use of steroids.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell cancer on the left upper chest, which was removed in the past. This indicates a personal history of a malignant neoplasm of the skin, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V10.83|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of osteoporosis, which is treated with Reclast once yearly. This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |733.00| for osteoporosis, unspecified.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypothyroidism, as mentioned in the Past Medical History section. This condition is managed with levothyroxine, which is listed both in the medications on admission and discharge. Therefore, the diagnosis of |244.9| (unspecified hypothyroidism) is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient has a documented history of hypertension (|401.9|) in the Past Medical History section, and her blood pressure readings during the hospital stay, such as 132/70, indicate ongoing hypertensive status, supporting the diagnosis of unspecified essential hypertension (|401.9|).\n\nThe patient has a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is explicitly mentioned in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. This condition is characterized by low platelet counts and increased bleeding risk, aligning with the target ICD code |287.31|. Therefore, the presence of ITP in the patient's medical history directly supports the assignment of the ICD code |287.31|.\n\nThe patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia secondary to a subtotal gastrectomy, which is explicitly mentioned in the Past Medical History section. This surgical procedure involves the removal of part of the stomach, leading to the acquired absence of stomach, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |V45.75|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a hysterectomy for uterine fibroids, which indicates the surgical removal of the uterus. Since the hysterectomy typically involves the removal of the cervix as well, this supports the inference of the ICD code |V88.01| for acquired absence of both cervix and uterus.\n\nThe patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with two-vessel disease (2VD), which is documented in the Past Medical History section. This condition is consistent with the diagnosis of |414.01|, indicating coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary arteries. The patient is also on medications such as metoprolol and furosemide, which are commonly used to manage CAD, further supporting the association with |414.01|.\n\nThe patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia secondary to a subtotal gastrectomy, which is mentioned in the Past Medical History section. Additionally, the discharge diagnosis includes iron deficiency anemia, and the patient's hematocrit remained stable during the hospitalization. These details support the assignment of the ICD-9 code |280.0| for iron deficiency anemia secondary to blood loss (chronic).\n\nThe patient has a history of asthma and has been on chronic steroids (prednisone 5 mg for several years), which is documented in both the \"History of Present Illness\" and \"Past Medical History\" sections. This long-term use of steroids for her asthma management directly supports the assignment of the ICD code |V58.65|, indicating an encounter for the long-term (current) use of steroids.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of carotid stenosis, which is documented in the clinical note. This condition directly corresponds to the ICD-9 code |433.10|, which describes occlusion and stenosis of the carotid artery without mention of cerebral infarction. Therefore, the presence of carotid stenosis in the patient's history justifies the assignment of the ICD-9 code |433.10|.\n\nThe patient has a history of asthma and is on chronic prednisone therapy, as evidenced by the medication list and the history of present illness noting \"history of asthma on chronic steroids.\" This long-term use of steroids for asthma management directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |493.90|, which denotes asthma, unspecified type, without mention of status asthmaticus.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |V58.65||V10.83||733.00||244.9||401.9||287.31||V45.75||V88.01||414.01||280.0||V58.65||433.10||493.90|.",

Although there is no explicit mention of urinary obstruction or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), the presence of BPH and the continuation of these medications support the diagnosis of |600.00|, indicating hypertrophy (benign) of the prostate without urinary obstruction and other LUTS.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient with a large pancreatic mass, confirmed by imaging and EUS, which shows a 2.7 cm x 2.5 cm ill-defined mass in the neck of the pancreas with irregular borders and vascular invasion. The patient also has a history of biliary obstruction and significant ascites, consistent with advanced pancreatic cancer. These findings, particularly the location of the mass in the head of the pancreas and the presence of biliary obstruction, support the diagnosis of a malignant neoplasm of the head of the pancreas, leading to the ICD code |157.0|.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient with a large pancreatic mass that has caused biliary obstruction, as evidenced by the elevated total bilirubin levels (TBili-4) and the presence of a 1.5 cm irregular stricture in the mid common bile duct (CBD) noted during ERCP. The ERCP procedure involved placing a biliary stent to relieve the obstruction, confirming the diagnosis of |576.2| obstruction of bile duct.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |401.9| (unspecified essential hypertension), which is explicitly mentioned in the \"Past Medical History\" section of the clinical note. Additionally, the patient's current medications include Metoprolol, a beta-blocker commonly used to manage hypertension, further supporting the diagnosis of |401.9|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent a \"U/S guided paracentesis\" to remove moderate ascites, which is a procedure involving percutaneous abdominal drainage. This procedure aligns with the ICD code |54.91|, indicating the use of percutaneous methods to drain fluid from the abdomen.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient who underwent an ERCP procedure, which included a sphincterotomy and the placement of a biliary stent to address a biliary obstruction caused by a pancreatic mass. The detailed description of the ERCP procedure, including the use of a sphincterotome to perform a biliary sphincterotomy and the placement of a 10mm x 60mm Wallflex uncovered metal biliary stent, directly supports the assignment of the ICD code |51.87| for endoscopic insertion of a stent into the bile duct.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a \"moderate amount of ascites\" and that a paracentesis was performed, which is consistent with the presence of ascites. Additionally, the note states that the ascites is \"concerning for stage IV pancreatic CA,\" suggesting that the ascites is likely malignant. Therefore, the diagnosis of |789.51| (malignant ascites) is supported by these findings.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), which is recently diagnosed and well-controlled. This information directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |250.00|, as it indicates type II diabetes mellitus without mention of complications or uncontrolled status.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient with a large pancreatic mass causing biliary obstruction, which is evident from the elevated total bilirubin levels (TBili-4) and the presence of a 1.5 cm irregular stricture in the mid common bile duct (CBD) noted during ERCP. The ERCP procedure involved placing a biliary stent to relieve the obstruction, indicating a disorder of the biliary tract. Therefore, the diagnosis of |576.8| (other specified disorders of biliary tract) is appropriate based on these findings.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has thrombocytopenia, as evidenced by the platelet count (Plt Ct) being consistently low at 61,000/\u00b5L on both admission and discharge labs. This finding directly supports the diagnosis of |287.5| (thrombocytopenia, unspecified).\n\nThe patient experienced hypotension upon arrival to the floor post-ERCP, with a systolic blood pressure of 84 mmHg and a heart rate of 55 bpm. This hypotension was attributed to the effects of medications such as propofol and metoprolol/esmolol administered during the procedure. The condition resolved with intravenous fluids and holding of home metoprolol, leading to normalization of blood pressure, supporting the diagnosis of |458.29| (other iatrogenic hypotension).\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |600.00||157.0||576.2||401.9||54.91||51.87||789.51||250.00||576.8||287.5||458.29|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes \"Probable early osteoarthritis in bilateral knees,\" which suggests the presence of osteoarthrosis affecting the lower extremities. Although the specific involvement of the lower leg is not explicitly mentioned, the general condition of osteoarthritis can reasonably extend to other parts of the lower extremities, including the lower leg. Therefore, the code |715.36| for osteoarthrosis, localized, not specified whether primary or secondary, involving the lower leg, can be inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient has a documented history of depression in her past medical history, which is listed among her chronic issues. This indicates a pre-existing condition of depressive disorder, aligning with the ICD code |311|. The continuation of her home medication, duloxetine, further supports the ongoing management of her depressive disorder.\n\nThe patient has a history of diastolic heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (EF >60%) and persistent lower extremity edema, which are consistent with the diagnosis of |428.32| (diastolic heart failure, chronic). The clinical note mentions her chronic heart failure and the management of her condition with medications such as ACE inhibitors and diuretics, further supporting the chronic nature of her diastolic heart failure.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II (|250.42|), which is evident from her past medical history and current medication regimen, including insulin detemir, humalog, metformin, exenatide, and glipizide. Additionally, her laboratory results show fluctuating glucose levels and an elevated creatinine, indicating potential renal involvement, which aligns with the code for uncontrolled diabetes with renal manifestations.\n\nThe patient has a history of gout, as mentioned in the Past Medical History section. Although there are no active symptoms or findings suggestive of a gout flare during this hospitalization, the presence of gout in her medical history justifies the assignment of the ICD-9 code |274.9| for gout, unspecified.\n\nThe patient presented with a chief complaint of leg pain and was diagnosed with cellulitis of the left lower extremity, characterized by erythema, induration, and pain, which are classic signs of |682.6|. The clinical course, including the administration of antibiotics and the improvement of symptoms, further supports the diagnosis of cellulitis of the leg.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II (DM type II), which is evident from the past medical history and the detailed management of her condition during the hospital stay. The clinical note mentions her use of multiple antidiabetic medications, including insulin detemir, humalog, metformin, exenatide, and glipizide, indicating that her diabetes is being actively managed. However, the note also describes significant fluctuations in her blood glucose levels during the hospitalization, suggesting poor glycemic control. Therefore, the target ICD code |250.82|, which denotes diabetes mellitus type II, uncontrolled, with other specified manifestations, is appropriate based on the clinical evidence provided.\n\nThe patient has a history of hyperlipidemia (|272.4|), which is supported by her past medical history and current medication regimen. She is on pravastatin, a lipid-lowering agent, indicating ongoing management of her hyperlipidemia. Additionally, her discharge medications include pravastatin, further confirming the diagnosis of |272.4|.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension (HTN) and was found to have an elevated creatinine level during her hospital stay, which increased from 1.6 to 2.0. Although her creatinine levels fluctuate and there is no definitive evidence of renal failure, the presence of hypertension and renal involvement suggests a diagnosis of hypertensive renal disease, unspecified, without mention of renal failure (|403.90|).\n\nThe patient has a history of diastolic heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (EF >60%) and persistent lower extremity edema, which are consistent with the diagnosis of |428.0| (congestive heart failure, unspecified). Despite the absence of acute exacerbation during this admission, the chronic condition and ongoing management with diuretics and ACE inhibitors support the association with this ICD code.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) with peripheral neuropathy, which is evident from the past medical history and the chief complaint of leg pain. The physical exam notes chronic skin changes and tinea on the soles and between digits, which are consistent with diabetic polyneuropathy. Therefore, the target ICD code |357.2| for polyneuropathy in diabetes is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, and her discharge medications include Levemir (insulin detemir), which is a long-term insulin therapy. This indicates that the patient is on long-term insulin treatment, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V58.67| for the encounter for long-term (current) use of insulin.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and was found to have an elevated creatinine level during her hospital stay, which increased from 1.6 to 2.0. Given her history of DM and the elevation in creatinine, there is a concern for diabetic nephropathy, which is a form of nephropathy associated with diabetes. Therefore, the code |583.81| (nephritis and nephropathy, not specified as acute or chronic, in diseases classified elsewhere) is applicable, reflecting the potential renal involvement in her diabetic condition.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C, which is noted as \"Chronic hepatitis C: Never treated.\" This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |070.54|, as it indicates the presence of chronic hepatitis C without any mention of hepatic coma.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) with peripheral neuropathy and possible nephropathy, as evidenced by her elevated creatinine levels (1.6 at admission, increasing to 2.0) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The clinical note mentions that her creatinine levels vary between 1.0-1.4, suggesting underlying renal impairment. These findings support the diagnosis of |583.81|, indicating nephritis and nephropathy in the context of her DM.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |715.36||311||428.32||250.42||274.9||682.6||250.82||272.4||403.90||428.0||357.2||V58.67||583.81||070.54||583.81|.",

These conditions are indicative of significant coronary atherosclerosis, which is further supported by the mention of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and the presence of a pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome, often associated with ischemic heart disease. Therefore, the diagnosis of |414.00| (coronary atherosclerosis of unspecified type of vessel, native or graft) is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient's history of tachy-brady syndrome and the notation that he is \"pacemaker dependent for sinus node dysfunction\" directly support the diagnosis of |427.81| (sinoatrial node dysfunction). This condition is further corroborated by the presence of a permanent pacemaker, indicating a chronic issue with the sinoatrial node.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |64.97||454.9||250.00||250.62||V12.72||493.90||412||V45.01||272.4||V45.81||401.9||V10.09||414.00||427.81|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) during her hospitalization, as evidenced by her creatinine peaking at 3.2 and gradually improving to 0.9. This AKI was attributed to hepatorenal syndrome precipitated by bacteremia, with a urine sodium level < 10, suggesting a pre-renal etiology. These findings support the diagnosis of |584.9| (acute renal failure, unspecified).\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent multiple colonoscopies during her hospital stay, including one where a 6mm nonbleeding sessile polyp was completely removed using a hot snare and another where a 1.5cm semipedunculated polyp was partially removed using a hot snare. These procedures align with the target ICD code |45.42|, which specifically refers to endoscopic polypectomy of the large intestine.\n\nThe clinical note describes multiple instances of paracentesis, which is a procedure involving the removal of fluid from the abdominal cavity. Specifically, the note mentions \"Paracentesis\" under Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures and details the patient's recurrent ascites and hepatic hydrothorax, which required frequent therapeutic paracenteses. These procedures align with the ICD code |54.91|, which denotes percutaneous abdominal drainage.\n\nThe clinical note indicates that the patient was transferred for possible liver transplant evaluation due to decompensated cirrhosis. Despite not meeting initial criteria for transplant due to lack of sobriety and deconditioning, the patient remains under consideration for future transplant. This ongoing evaluation and potential future transplant planning justify the assignment of the ICD code |V49.83|, indicating awaiting organ transplant status.\n\nThe patient has a documented history of subclinical hypothyroidism, which is consistent with the diagnosis of |244.9| (unspecified hypothyroidism). This is supported by the past medical history section mentioning \"Subclinical hypothyroidism,\" and the patient is also prescribed levothyroxine sodium, indicating ongoing management of thyroid hormone levels.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions multiple instances of significant fluid accumulation, including \"very distended c/w large volume of ascites\" and \"large right pleural effusion.\" These findings indicate the presence of significant fluid overload, which aligns with the ICD code |276.69| for other fluid overload. The repeated need for paracentesis and thoracentesis further supports the diagnosis of fluid overload.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with the placement of a feeding tube, which is a form of endoscopic examination. While the primary focus of the EGD was to place a feeding tube, the procedure inherently involves endoscopic visualization of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the small intestine. Therefore, the code |45.13| for other endoscopy of the small intestine can be reasonably inferred from this description.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of |572.2| (hepatic encephalopathy) and describes symptoms such as confusion and altered mental status, which are consistent with hepatic coma. The note also indicates that the patient had a history of hepatic encephalopathy on admission, which did not recur during the hospitalization, further supporting the diagnosis of |572.2|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent a thoracentesis to drain a right-sided pleural effusion, which was confirmed by imaging and associated with symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia. This procedure is explicitly documented in the brief hospital course and imaging reports, leading to the assignment of the ICD code |34.91|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note clearly indicates a diagnosis of |571.2| (alcoholic cirrhosis of liver). This is supported by her history of ethanol abuse, current presentation with refractory ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic hydrothorax, all of which are common complications of alcoholic cirrhosis. Additionally, her laboratory results, including elevated liver enzymes and low albumin, further confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions multiple instances of ascites, including \"very distended c/w large volume of ascites\" on admission and \"mild ascites\" on discharge. Additionally, the patient required frequent therapeutic paracenteses to manage the ascites, indicating a persistent and significant accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. These findings clearly support the diagnosis of |789.59| (other ascites).\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent an EGD which revealed \"granularity, erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the fundus, stomach body and antrum compatible with portal gastropathy.\" This finding suggests inflammation and changes in the gastric mucosa, which aligns with the diagnosis of |535.50|, indicating unspecified gastritis and gastroduodenitis without mention of hemorrhage.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with the placement of a feeding tube beyond the duodenum, indicating that the procedure involved endoscopic examination of the small intestine. This procedure aligns with the ICD code |45.13|, which describes other endoscopy of the small intestine.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of esophageal varices, which are often associated with portal hypertension. Additionally, the EGD findings include granularity, erythema, congestion, and a mosaic appearance in the fundus, stomach body, and antrum, which are consistent with portal gastropathy, a condition that can result from portal hypertension. Therefore, the presence of these findings strongly supports the diagnosis of |572.3| portal hypertension.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions multiple instances of pleural effusion, specifically noting a \"new right-sided pleural effusion\" on the morning of admission, which was confirmed by chest X-ray and described as a \"large right effusion\" in subsequent imaging reports. The effusion was attributed to her underlying cirrhosis and was managed with multiple thoracenteses. These findings and interventions clearly indicate the presence of an |511.9|: unspecified pleural effusion.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent a colonoscopy during her hospital stay, which revealed multiple polyps in the sigmoid and ascending colon. Specifically, the note states, \"A 2.5-3cm nonbleeding pedunculated polyp was seen in the sigmoid colon\" and \"A 1.5cm nonbleeding sessile polyp was noted in the ascending colon.\" These findings indicate the presence of benign neoplasms in the colon, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |211.3|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of |266.2| (other B-complex deficiencies), specifically B12 deficiency, as evidenced by the lab results showing low Vitamin B12 levels (<5) and the administration of cyanocobalamin 500 mcg PO daily. This supports the diagnosis of |266.2|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she was transferred for \"liver transplant evaluation\" and that she \"began the process for transplant evaluation with EGD, colonoscopy x2 (with polypectomy), pap smear, routine labwork and initiated contact with social work.\" This indicates that the patient is actively being considered for a liver transplant, which aligns with the ICD code |V49.83| for awaiting organ transplant status.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of external hemorrhoids, which were observed during the colonoscopy procedures. There is no mention of any complications associated with these hemorrhoids. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-9 code for this condition is |455.3|, indicating external hemorrhoids without mention of complication.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with the placement of a feeding tube beyond the third part of the duodenum. This procedure is specifically noted as \"A 10 French feeding tube was placed beyond [portion of] the duodenum,\" indicating the insertion of a percutaneous (endoscopic) jejunostomy tube, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |46.32|.\n\nThe patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis with refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome, which are complications often associated with portal hypertension. During the hospitalization, the patient developed a large right pleural effusion, which was identified as a transudative effusion (hepatic hydrothorax) and required multiple thoracenteses. This condition is a manifestation of portal hypertension, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |572.3|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent two colonoscopies during her hospital stay, both of which revealed multiple polyps in the sigmoid and ascending colon. Specifically, the first colonoscopy identified a 2.5-3 cm nonbleeding pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon and a 1.5 cm nonbleeding sessile polyp in the ascending colon. The second colonoscopy confirmed the presence of a 1.5 cm semipedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon and a 4-5 mm sessile polyp in the ascending colon, both of which were removed and sent for histology. These findings support the diagnosis of |569.0|, indicating the presence of anal and rectal polyps.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of |287.5| (thrombocytopenia), which is evident from the laboratory results showing a platelet count of 54* on admission and 49* on discharge. These values are significantly below the normal range, confirming the presence of thrombocytopenia. Additionally, the patient's coagulopathy and requirement for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to procedures further support the diagnosis of |287.5|.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |584.9||45.42||54.91||V49.83||244.9||276.69||45.13||572.2||34.91||571.2||789.59||535.50||45.13||572.3||511.9||211.3||266.2||V49.83||455.3||46.32||572.3||569.0||287.5|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient exhibited rapid mood alterations and disorientation, particularly in the evening and night, which are consistent with symptoms of delirium. These symptoms were noted to be similar to a previous episode during a prior hospitalization, suggesting a recurrent issue. Therefore, the diagnosis of |293.0| (delirium due to conditions classified elsewhere) is appropriate, given the context of her multiple medical conditions and recent traumatic event.\n\nThe patient has a history of a left deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was on apixaban, which was temporarily held upon admission. The discharge medications include apixaban 5 mg PO BID, indicating that the patient will continue long-term anticoagulant therapy for the management of her DVT. Therefore, the encounter is appropriately coded as |V58.61| for the long-term use of anticoagulants.\n\nThe patient experienced tachycardia, as evidenced by the new onset of tachycardia noted on the morning of admission, with a heart rate trending upward despite initial fluid boluses. This condition is documented in the \"Brief Hospital Course\" section, where it states, \"Tachycardia: new problem as of ___ AM. Likely fluid depletion, as 500 cc bolus helped bring down HR, though afterwards, she crept back up.\" This clinical presentation supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |785.0| for tachycardia, unspecified.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes hyperlipidemia (|272.4|), as evidenced by the medication simvastatin 40 mg PO daily listed both on admission and discharge. This indicates ongoing management of hyperlipidemia, supporting the assignment of the ICD-9 code |272.4|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions an \"unstable T12 vertebral body fracture\" identified on CT imaging, which aligns with the diagnosis of a closed fracture of the thoracic vertebra without mention of spinal cord injury, corresponding to the ICD-9 code |805.2|. The note specifies that the fracture disrupts the anterior and middle columns, but does not indicate any spinal cord injury, supporting the use of this specific code.\n\nThe patient has a history of asthma, as noted in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. This condition is further supported by the ongoing use of asthma medications such as Symbicort and albuterol (ProAir HFA) listed in both the admission and discharge medications. Therefore, the diagnosis of |493.20| (chronic obstructive asthma, without mention of status asthmaticus) is appropriately inferred from the clinical information provided.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient had a potassium level of 2.9 on admission, which is below the normal range, indicating |276.8| hypokalemia. This condition was addressed with IV and oral potassium repletion, and subsequent lab results showed improvement, with a potassium level of 4.2 after repletion. The diagnosis of hypokalemia is further supported by the discontinuation of HCTZ and atenolol due to their potential to lower potassium levels.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a normocytic anemia with an acute drop in hemoglobin levels from 12.4 to 7.4, which responded to a transfusion of one unit of blood. Although the exact cause of the anemia is unclear, the note suggests it may be anemia of chronic disease (ACD) rather than iron deficiency anemia. However, the presence of a significant drop in hemoglobin and the need for transfusion, combined with the lack of specific details pointing to another type of anemia, supports the inference of |280.9| (iron deficiency anemia, unspecified).\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |530.81| esophageal reflux, as documented in the section listing her chronic conditions. While the clinical note does not provide specific details about active symptoms or treatment related to esophageal reflux, the presence of this condition in her medical history justifies the assignment of the |530.81| code.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of hypertension (HTN) under the Past Medical History section, indicating a pre-existing condition of essential hypertension. Although the specific type of hypertension is not specified, the presence of hypertension is clearly documented, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |401.9| for unspecified essential hypertension.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a \"large posterior scalp hematoma\" observed on CT head without contrast, which is consistent with a contusion of the scalp. This finding, along with the absence of any intracranial hemorrhage or fracture, supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |920| for contusion of the face, scalp, and neck except the eyes.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of anxiety/depression in the Past Medical History section, indicating a pre-existing mental health condition. Additionally, the patient exhibits symptoms of delirium and confusion during the hospital stay, which can often be associated with underlying anxiety. Therefore, the presence of these symptoms and the documented history support the assignment of the ICD code |300.00| for an anxiety state, unspecified.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she fell down two flights of stairs, which is a clear indication of an accidental fall on or from stairs. This event led to multiple spinal fractures and other injuries, aligning with the ICD-9 code |E880.9| for accidental fall on or from other stairs or steps.\n\nThe patient has a history of a left deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was on apixaban, which was initially held upon presentation due to the fall. The clinical note mentions that the patient was discharged on apixaban 5 mg PO BID to complete the remaining months of anticoagulation for the prior DVT, as per the conversation with her primary care physician. This indicates a personal history of venous thrombosis and embolism, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V12.51|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of depression, as noted in the section \"Past Medical History\" under \"Anxiety/Depression.\" This indicates a pre-existing condition of depressive disorder, which aligns with the ICD code |311|: depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified. The clinical note does not provide specific details about the current state of her depression, but the presence of this diagnosis in her medical history supports the assignment of the code.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a normocytic anemia with an acute drop in hemoglobin levels, which could be indicative of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). The note also describes a trend in hemoglobin levels and the administration of a blood transfusion, suggesting a focus on managing anemia. However, the specific mention of thrombocytopenia, noted as \"thrombocytopenia: unclear given no baseline,\" aligns with the target ICD code |287.49|, which denotes other secondary thrombocytopenia. This code is appropriate if the thrombocytopenia is secondary to another condition, such as the patient's multiple fractures and anemia, rather than a primary hematologic disorder.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a \"right posterior eighth rib fracture\" identified on CT imaging, which is a closed fracture as there is no mention of an open wound or penetration. This finding directly corresponds to the ICD-9 code |807.01|, which specifies a closed fracture of one rib.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient had a low serum potassium level (K=2.9) on admission, which is indicative of dehydration |276.51|. Additionally, the note states that the patient was \"possibly dry upon coming in,\" further supporting the diagnosis of dehydration |276.51|. The patient's hypokalemia was managed with IV and oral potassium repletion, and her hydration status was monitored throughout the hospital stay.\n\nThe patient exhibited rapid mood alteration and disorientation, particularly in the evening and night, which are symptoms consistent with delirium. These symptoms were noted to be similar to a previous episode during a prior hospitalization, suggesting a recurrent issue. Given the context of the patient's multiple medical conditions and recent traumatic event, the diagnosis of delirium due to conditions classified elsewhere (|293.0|) is appropriate.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |293.0||V58.61||785.0||272.4||805.2||493.20||276.8||280.9||530.81||401.9||920||300.00||E880.9||V12.51||311||287.49||807.01||276.51||293.0|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient has a history of multiple falls, particularly since starting clonazepam, which is a sedative and hypnotic. The clinical note mentions that the patient's falls are likely due to the sedating effects of clonazepam, along with other sedating medications such as gabapentin, Lunesta, and narcotic pain medications. This aligns with the ICD code |E937.8|, indicating adverse effects from sedatives and hypnotics in therapeutic use.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic neck and gluteal pain, as noted in the Past Medical History section, which indicates ongoing cervicalgia. Additionally, the physical exam mentions tenderness to palpation (TTP) in the neck, further supporting the presence of cervicalgia. Therefore, the diagnosis of |723.1| (cervicalgia) is justified based on these findings.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes hypercholesterolemia, which is documented in the list of conditions. Additionally, the discharge medications include simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering medication, indicating ongoing management of |272.0| pure hypercholesterolemia.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic neck, gluteal, and multiple joint pains, as well as a recent fall resulting in left knee, hip, and shoulder pain. These symptoms, particularly the chronic nature of the pain and the involvement of multiple joints, align with the diagnosis of |729.1|, which encompasses myalgia and myositis, unspecified.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain, as noted in the Past Medical History section, which includes multiple hospital admissions for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional GI disorder. This chronic condition is further supported by the ongoing use of chronic narcotics for pain management and the continuation of medications like lansoprazole and sucralfate for gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, the diagnosis of |338.29| (other chronic pain) is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic neck, gluteal, and multiple joint pains, which are consistent with |338.19| (other acute pain). During this admission, she experienced acute pain in her left knee, hip, shoulder, and hand following a fall, as documented in the history of present illness and physical exam. These acute pain symptoms, along with the need for immediate pain management, support the assignment of |338.19|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |268.9| (unspecified vitamin D deficiency), as evidenced by the list of chronic conditions and the discharge medications, which include cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 400 units daily. This indicates ongoing management of her vitamin D deficiency, supporting the assignment of the ICD code |268.9|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of iron deficiency anemia, specifically listed under the Past Medical History section. This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |280.9| for iron deficiency anemia, unspecified. The note does not provide additional details about the current status or treatment of this condition, but the historical documentation is sufficient to justify the code.\n\nThe patient has a history of |311| dysthymic disorder, which is evident from the Past Medical History section where it states \"depression/anxiety (dysthymic mood disorder).\" This condition is further supported by the Social History, which notes a family history of mental health issues, including depression and bipolar disorder. The discharge diagnosis and instructions also emphasize the importance of managing her psychiatric medications, such as clonazepam, to reduce the risk of falls and other complications associated with her chronic conditions.\n\nThe patient has a history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional GI disorder, with multiple hospital admissions for IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea. The review of systems notes that the patient has experienced diarrhea over the past several days, which aligns with the diagnosis of |564.1| for irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nThe patient's history includes a past medical condition of morbid obesity, as evidenced by the statement \"s/p open ___ gastric bypass (___) - h/o morbid obesity\" in the Past Medical History section. This indicates that the patient has undergone bariatric surgery due to severe overweight, which aligns with the diagnosis of |278.00|: obesity, unspecified.\n\nThe patient presented with a syncopal event, where she experienced a transient loss of consciousness and fell to the floor, as reported by her brother. The clinical note documents the episode of syncope, along with the absence of preceding symptoms and the lack of acute injuries or fractures on imaging. These findings support the primary discharge diagnosis of |780.2| (syncope and collapse).\n\nThe patient has a history of multiple falls, particularly since starting clonazepam, which she has been taking more frequently than prescribed. This suggests that the falls are likely medication-related, as indicated by the adjustment of her clonazepam dose and the recommendation to discontinue narcotic pain medications. Therefore, the code |E888.9| for an unspecified fall is appropriate based on the clinical context provided.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic neck, gluteal, and multiple joint pains, which are consistent with a diagnosis of |729.89| (other musculoskeletal symptoms referable to limbs). The clinical note mentions complaints of left knee pain, left hip pain, left shoulder pain, and left hand pain following a fall, further supporting this diagnosis. Additionally, the physical exam notes tenderness to palpation (TTP) in the left knee, which aligns with the musculoskeletal symptoms described.\n\nThe patient has a history of multiple falls at home occurring primarily since the initiation of clonazepam, which she has been taking more frequently than prescribed. This pattern of falls, along with the use of several sedating medications, suggests that her falls are likely due to a medication effect, leading to the assignment of the ICD code |E849.0| for home accidents.\n\nThe patient has a history of migraine headaches, as noted in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. Although the current admission is primarily for syncope and falls, the presence of migraines in her medical history supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |346.90| for migraine, unspecified, without mention of intractable migraine.\n\nThe patient has a history of pernicious anemia, as noted in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. Although there are no specific symptoms or recent lab results mentioned that directly relate to active pernicious anemia, the historical diagnosis supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |281.0|.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic neck, gluteal, and multiple joint pains, as well as a recent fall resulting in left knee, hip, and shoulder pain. Imaging studies of the left shoulder, hand, knee, and pelvis did not show any acute fractures or dislocations, but the patient's ongoing complaints of pain in these areas, particularly the left shoulder, indicate a condition consistent with |719.41|, pain in joint involving the shoulder region.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |477.9|, allergic rhinitis, cause unspecified, which is mentioned in the list of medical conditions. This indicates that the patient has a documented history of allergic rhinitis, even though there are no specific symptoms or treatments related to this condition mentioned in the current admission. Therefore, the presence of |477.9| in the past medical history justifies the inclusion of this ICD code.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension, as noted in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. Although there are no specific blood pressure readings or detailed hypertensive symptoms mentioned in the current admission, the presence of hypertension in her medical history justifies the assignment of the ICD-9 code |401.9| for unspecified essential hypertension.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |E937.8||723.1||272.0||729.1||338.29||338.19||268.9||280.9||311||564.1||278.00||780.2||E888.9||729.89||E849.0||346.90||281.0||719.41||477.9||401.9|.",

This adverse reaction to heparin, leading to a drug rash and the need for alternative anticoagulation, aligns with the diagnosis of dermatitis due to drugs and medicines taken internally, coded as |693.0|.\n\nThe patient has a history of schizoprhenia, which is documented in the Past Medical History section. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, which align with the diagnostic criteria for |295.90| (unspecified schizophrenia, unspecified state). The clinical note mentions that the patient was on anti-psychotic medications, further supporting the diagnosis of schizophrenia.\n\nThe patient developed a morbilliform drug rash while on heparin, which was later confirmed to be heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with a positive HIT antibody test. This adverse reaction led to the discontinuation of heparin and a switch to argatroban and warfarin. Therefore, the code |E879.8| is appropriate as it captures the specified procedure (heparin administration) causing an abnormal reaction in the patient.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions persistent sinus tachycardia, with heart rates ranging from 100-110 beats per minute, which is noted to be chronic and unexplained despite treatment. This finding directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |427.89| for other specified cardiac dysrhythmias, specifically sinus tachycardia.\n\nThe patient presented with acute hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, as evidenced by initial ABG showing pH 7.30, PaCO2 76, and PaO2 55, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The clinical course was further complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli and ventilator-associated pneumonia, necessitating prolonged ICU stay and aggressive respiratory support. These findings clearly support the diagnosis of |518.81| acute respiratory failure.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |300.00| (anxiety state, unspecified), which is directly mentioned in the clinical note under \"Past Medical History.\" Additionally, the patient's mental status on discharge is described as \"clear and coherent,\" suggesting ongoing management of his anxiety condition. Therefore, the presence of |300.00| is supported by both the historical documentation and the current mental status evaluation.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates that he experienced acute respiratory failure and was intubated, leading to a prolonged stay in the ICU. Specifically, the note mentions that the patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU, where he remained on the ventilator for about two weeks. This duration of mechanical ventilation exceeds 96 consecutive hours, thus justifying the assignment of the ICD code |96.72|.\n\nThe patient developed a morbilliform drug rash while on heparin, which was later diagnosed as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This condition is characterized by thrombocytopenia, which is evident from the clinical note mentioning \"thrombocytopenia\" in the context of the HIT diagnosis. Therefore, the target ICD code |287.5| (thrombocytopenia, unspecified) is appropriately associated with this patient's condition.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and started on heparin, which later caused a morbilliform drug rash, leading to a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). As a result, the heparin was discontinued and the patient was transitioned to argatroban and subsequently to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. This change in medication and the need for ongoing anticoagulant therapy indicate an encounter for long-term (current) use of anticoagulants, corresponding to the ICD code |V58.61|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |272.4| (other and unspecified hyperlipidemia), which is directly mentioned in the clinical note. This diagnosis is consistent with the patient's ongoing management of hyperlipidemia, as evidenced by the continuation of simvastatin in the discharge medications. Therefore, the presence of |272.4| is clearly supported by the clinical documentation.\n\nThe patient's clinical note describes a history of COPD and an acute presentation with wheezing, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia, which are consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The note mentions that the patient was treated with albuterol and nebulizers, indicating an exacerbation of his underlying obstructive chronic bronchitis. Therefore, the diagnosis of |491.21| (obstructive chronic bronchitis with (acute) exacerbation) is supported by the clinical presentation and treatment provided.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli on a repeat CT scan, which led to the initiation of anticoagulation therapy with heparin, argatroban, and eventually warfarin. This diagnosis and treatment are consistent with the ICD code |415.19|, which covers other pulmonary embolism and infarction.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on clinical presentation, including hypoxia, respiratory distress, and a positive sputum culture for Haemophilus influenzae. The treatment included antibiotics, specifically steroids and nebulizers, and a course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. These findings and interventions align with the diagnosis of |482.9|, bacterial pneumonia, unspecified.\n\nThe patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during his hospital stay, as evidenced by the clinical note stating \"Given lack of progress and continued hypoxia and fevers, the patient underwent CT chest/abdomen/pelvis on ___, which revealed multiple pulmonary embolisms. Started on a heparin drip. Soon after the patient was noted to have a morbilliform drug rash and the heparin was switched to argatroban/warfarin. Tobramycin was added for continued fevers and concern for VAP.\" This indicates that the patient developed a respiratory infection while on mechanical ventilation, leading to the diagnosis of |997.31|.\n\nThe patient developed a morbilliform drug rash while on heparin, which was later confirmed to be heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This adverse reaction to heparin, an anticoagulant, during therapeutic use, aligns with the ICD-9 code |E934.2|.\n\nThe patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated in the history of present illness and brief hospital course sections. This intervention suggests the use of continuous mechanical ventilation, which aligns with the ICD code |96.51| for continuous mechanical ventilation for less than 96 consecutive hours.\n\nThe patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated in the history of present illness and the brief hospital course. The clinical note mentions that the patient was extubated on a specific date, implying that the duration of mechanical ventilation was less than 96 consecutive hours, thus supporting the assignment of the ICD code |96.71|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that he was intubated and required sedation due to agitation, which is consistent with |349.82| (toxic encephalopathy). The note also describes the patient becoming acutely agitated while on BiPAP and requiring significant sedation, suggesting a possible toxic or metabolic cause for his altered mental status. These findings support the diagnosis of |349.82|.\n\nThe patient developed a morbilliform drug rash while on heparin, which was later confirmed to be heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This adverse reaction to the anticoagulant heparin, leading to a change in medication to argatroban and warfarin, aligns with the ICD code |E947.8|, indicating an adverse effect from a medicinal substance used therapeutically.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of smoking and active smoking status, which is a key indicator of |305.1| (tobacco use disorder). This information is explicitly stated in the Social History section, supporting the inference of the diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |693.0||295.90||E879.8||427.89||518.81||300.00||96.72||287.5||V58.61||272.4||491.21||415.19||482.9||997.31||E934.2||96.51||96.71||349.82||E947.8||305.1|.",

This indicates a pre-existing condition of depression, supporting the assignment of the ICD code |311|. Additionally, the patient's history of substance abuse and recent intoxication may be related to his depressive disorder, further reinforcing the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient presented with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss after injecting IV heroin and IV cocaine, as noted in the history of present illness and the discharge diagnosis. The toxicology consultation confirmed the presence of ototoxicity associated with opiate exposure, and the patient's hearing improved over the course of monitoring, leading to the appropriate assignment of the ICD-9 code |389.9| for unspecified hearing loss.\n\nThe patient presented with a creatinine level of 1.4 on admission, which is elevated and suggests acute renal impairment. This elevation in creatinine, combined with the normalization of creatinine levels to 0.8 by the time of discharge, indicates an episode of acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal causes such as dehydration from IV drug use. Therefore, the diagnosis of |584.9| (acute renal failure, unspecified) is supported by the clinical course and laboratory findings.\n\nThe patient presented with hyperkalemia, as evidenced by an initial potassium level of 6.5 mEq/L, which normalized to 4.9 mEq/L after treatment with calcium gluconate and sodium bicarbonate. This finding, along with the clinical context of recent IV drug use and elevated creatinine, supports the diagnosis of |276.7| (hyperkalemia).\n\nThe patient presented with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss after injecting IV heroin and IV cocaine, as documented in the history of present illness and the discharge diagnosis. Toxicology consultation confirmed the association between opiate exposure and acute ototoxicity, supporting the diagnosis of |389.10|: sensorineural hearing loss, unspecified.\n\nThe patient presented with an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of 1732 U/L on admission, which is significantly higher than the normal range, indicating muscle breakdown. This finding, combined with the clinical context of recent IV drug use and potential immobility, supports the diagnosis of |728.88| (rhabdomyolysis). The CK level remained elevated at 1138 U/L on the day of discharge, further confirming this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient presented with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.1 on admission, which is elevated above the normal range, indicating leukocytosis. This leukocytosis is noted to be most likely a stress response in the setting of intravenous drug use (IVDU) and subsequent hearing problems, with no signs of infection. Therefore, the diagnosis of |288.60| (leukocytosis, unspecified) is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient's history of polysubstance abuse, specifically the use of IV heroin and IV cocaine, as detailed in the clinical note, directly supports the diagnosis of |305.90|, which denotes other, mixed, or unspecified drug abuse, unspecified use. The note explicitly mentions the patient's recent drug use and its potential impact on his health, including the development of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and other metabolic abnormalities. This information aligns with the criteria for |305.90|, reflecting a pattern of mixed drug abuse.\n\nThe patient's history of polysubstance abuse, specifically the use of IV heroin and IV cocaine, as documented in the clinical note, directly supports the diagnosis of |305.60| (cocaine abuse, unspecified use). The note mentions that the patient injected both heroin and cocaine, and the elevated troponin levels were attributed to vasospasm from cocaine use, further confirming the presence of cocaine abuse.\n\nThe patient's history of polysubstance abuse, specifically the use of IV heroin and IV cocaine, as documented in the clinical note, directly supports the diagnosis of |305.50| (opioid abuse, unspecified use). The note mentions that the patient injected IV heroin, which is a clear indication of opioid abuse. Additionally, the patient's presentation with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and elevated creatinine levels is consistent with the known effects of opioid toxicity, further supporting the diagnosis of |305.50|.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |311||389.9||584.9||276.7||389.10||728.88||288.60||305.90||305.60||305.50|.",

Additionally, the discharge instructions include detailed guidance on managing the J-tube for tube feeds, indicating the use of enteral nutrition. Therefore, the code |96.6| for enteral infusion of concentrated nutritional substances is appropriately inferred from the clinical note.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions \"Post-op Blood Loss anemia\" under the discharge diagnoses, indicating that the patient experienced significant blood loss during the surgical procedure, leading to anemia. This is further supported by the laboratory results showing low hemoglobin levels (HGB-9.0 to 9.7 g/dL) and hematocrit values (calcHCT-27% to 29%) throughout the hospital stay. Therefore, the diagnosis of |285.1| acute posthemorrhagic anemia is justified based on these findings.\n\nThe patient underwent multiple procedures involving the digestive system, including a choledochojejunostomy (Roux-en-Y) and a gastroenterostomy, which are detailed in the \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section. These procedures involve creating new connections between the bile duct and the jejunum, as well as between different segments of the gastrointestinal tract, thus falling under the category of |51.95|, other enterostomy.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of gout, which is documented in the clinical note under \"Past Medical History: PMH: HTN, Dyslipidemia, EGD ___ with gastric/duodenal ulcers, Gout, Neuropathy, Back pain, h/o carpal tunnel, cervical radiculopathy.\" This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |274.9| for gout, unspecified.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient who underwent a **duodenal cutaneous fistula takedown with primary closure of the duodenum** as part of the major surgical procedures. This procedure involves closing a fistula in the duodenum, which aligns with the ICD-9 code |46.74| for closure of fistula of stomach or duodenum. The detailed description of the surgical intervention and the specific mention of the duodenal fistula closure provide strong evidence for the application of this code.\n\nThe patient underwent a **Choledochojejunostomy (Roux-en-Y)** as part of the major surgical procedures listed in the clinical note. This procedure involves creating an anastomosis between the common bile duct and the jejunum, which is classified under the ICD-9 code |51.37| for anastomosis of the common duct to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the presence of this specific surgical intervention directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |51.37|.\n\nThe patient underwent a **J-tube placement** as part of the major surgical procedures, which is evident from the clinical note stating \"J-tube placement\" under the list of procedures. This procedure involves creating an enterostomy to provide access for nutritional support, aligning with the ICD-9 code |46.39| for other enterostomy.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient had a percutaneous drain in the right flank with murky, yellow fluid, indicating the presence of a peritoneal abscess. Additionally, the radiology report from the CT abdomen with contrast shows a small rim-enhancing fluid collection with a focus of gas in the left abdomen, further supporting the diagnosis of a peritoneal abscess. These findings justify the assignment of the ICD-9 code |567.22| for peritoneal abscess.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent a \"Small-bowel resection\" as part of the major surgical procedures, which suggests that a portion of the small intestine was removed. This resection implies the need for an anastomosis to reconnect the remaining segments of the small intestine, leading to the inference of the ICD code |45.91| for small-to-small intestinal anastomosis.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a \"duodenal cutaneous fistula\" and a \"fistulogram\" that showed a communication between a retroperitoneal right upper quadrant abscess collection and the duodenum. This indicates the presence of a fistula involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue, which aligns with the ICD-9 code |998.6|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient had a percutaneous drain in the right flank with murky, yellow fluid, indicating the presence of a peritoneal abscess. Additionally, the culture from the peritoneal abscess revealed *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, a gram-negative organism. These findings support the diagnosis of a gram-negative organism infection, which is classified under the ICD code |041.85|.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient with a history of recurrent retroperitoneal sepsis, which was confirmed by imaging studies showing a lateral tenting of the duodenum into the retroperitoneum consistent with a fistula tract and a small rim-enhancing fluid collection with a focus of gas in the left abdomen. These findings, along with the surgical intervention for drainage of retroperitoneal sepsis, clearly indicate the presence of a disorder of the retroperitoneum, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |568.89| for other specified disorders of the retroperitoneum and peritoneum.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes neuropathy, which is documented in the clinical note under \"Past Medical History.\" This indicates a pre-existing condition affecting the nerves, leading to the diagnosis of |355.9|, mononeuritis of unspecified site.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent a gastroenterostomy and a J-tube placement, both of which involve creating pathways for the digestive system. Additionally, the note describes the use of a J-tube for enteral feeding and the presence of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) for managing nausea and vomiting. These details suggest the need for ongoing attention to the newly created openings of the digestive tract, aligning with the ICD code |V55.4| for attention to other artificial openings of the digestive tract.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a \"rash related to antibiotic allergy\" and describes symptoms such as \"rash per abdomen, lower extremity - worsened,\" indicating a drug-induced dermatological reaction. This aligns with the diagnosis of |693.0|, which refers to dermatitis due to drugs and medicines taken internally.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |568.0||E930.8||45.62||537.4||272.4||401.9||576.2||96.6||285.1||51.95||274.9||46.74||51.37||46.39||567.22||45.91||998.6||041.85||568.89||355.9||V55.4||693.0|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient has a history of multifactorial anemia, which includes chronic kidney disease (CRI), chronic disease, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The clinical note mentions that the patient's anemia is multifactorial, with a stable hematocrit at baseline, indicating ongoing management of anemia related to her chronic conditions. Therefore, the diagnosis of |285.9| (anemia, unspecified) is appropriate based on the provided information.\n\nThe patient has a history of breast cancer, as evidenced by the past medical history section stating \"Breast cancer s/p lumpectomy & XRT.\" This indicates that the patient has undergone radiation therapy for breast cancer in the past, which aligns with the ICD code |V15.3| for personal history of irradiation, presenting hazards to health.\n\nThe patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is documented in both the Past Medical History and the Discharge Diagnosis sections of the clinical note. Crohn's disease is a form of regional enteritis, and the specific mention of \"Crohn's disease\" without specifying a particular site aligns with the ICD-9 code |555.9|, which denotes regional enteritis of unspecified site.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates that she was on enoxaparin (Lovenox) for her history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and saddle embolus, and was continued on this anticoagulant during her hospital stay. Additionally, the discharge medications list includes enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours, confirming the ongoing use of anticoagulants. Therefore, the encounter is appropriately coded as |V58.61|, indicating long-term use of anticoagulants.\n\nThe patient's history includes a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which is documented in the Past Medical History section. This indicates the presence of coronary atherosclerosis, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |414.01| for coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60-70%, as noted in the Past Medical History section. During the hospital stay, the patient presented with fluid overload and dyspnea, which are common symptoms of |428.0| (congestive heart failure, unspecified). The chest X-ray (CXR) also showed findings consistent with fluid overload, further supporting the diagnosis of |428.0|.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness mentions a history of CAD s/p NSTEMI, which indicates a past myocardial infarction. This is further supported by the past medical history section, which explicitly states \"CAD s/p NSTEMI |412|.\" Therefore, the target ICD code |412| for old myocardial infarction is justified based on the documented medical history.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) diagnosed several years ago, which is directly relevant to the ICD code |238.75|. The note also indicates that the patient has multifactorial anemia, which is consistent with the hematological abnormalities often seen in MDS. These details provide strong evidence for the assignment of the ICD code |238.75|.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine range of 1.5-1.8, which is consistent with hypertensive renal disease. The clinical note mentions multiple instances of hyperkalemia and elevated creatinine levels, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. Given the patient's history of hypertension and CAD, the diagnosis of |403.90| (hypertensive renal disease, unspecified, without mention of renal failure) is supported by the chronic nature of her renal impairment and the absence of specific mention of renal failure.\n\nThe patient presented with hyperkalemia, as evidenced by a potassium level of 6.9 on admission, which is significantly elevated compared to her baseline of 5.0. This condition was managed with kayexalate and furosemide, and subsequent labs showed a reduction in potassium levels. Therefore, the diagnosis of |276.7| (hyperpotassemia) is appropriately coded based on these clinical findings and interventions.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates a history of chronic diastolic heart failure (|428.32|) with an ejection fraction of 60-70%. The note mentions that the patient presented with fluid overload and dyspnea, which are consistent with exacerbation of her chronic diastolic heart failure. Additionally, the patient was diuresed with lasix, and her symptoms improved, further supporting the diagnosis of |428.32|.\n\nThe patient presented with altered mental status (AMS) and dyspnea, and was found to have a positive blood culture from the PICC line, indicating a suspected line infection. This led to the initiation of vancomycin for a two-week course, suggesting a diagnosis of bloodstream infection due to the central venous catheter, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |999.32|.\n\nThe patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a saddle embolus, for which she was initially on warfarin and later transitioned to lovenox due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite this, she experienced a PICC-associated left upper extremity DVT and hematoma, necessitating the use of lovenox. These events indicate a history of venous thrombosis and embolism, supporting the assignment of the ICD code |V12.51|.\n\nThe patient has a history of breast cancer, as evidenced by the past medical history section stating \"Breast cancer s/p lumpectomy & XRT.\" This indicates that the patient has undergone surgical treatment and radiation therapy for breast cancer in the past, which aligns with the ICD-9 code |V10.3| for personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast.\n\nThe patient presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, and was found to have a positive blood culture from the PICC line, indicating a suspected line infection. This, combined with the administration of vancomycin for a two-week course, strongly suggests a diagnosis of |999.31|, infection due to central venous catheter.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of GERD, which is documented under the past medical history section. This condition is directly associated with esophageal reflux, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |530.81|. The note also indicates that the patient was continued on omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor commonly used to manage GERD, further supporting the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions \"Chronic bilateral ___ edema\" in the Past Medical History section, indicating a history of edema. Additionally, the physical exam notes \"WWP, 2+ pulses,\" suggesting the presence of edema. These findings support the assignment of the ICD-9 code |782.3| for edema.\n\nThe patient's history includes a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the past. This history of CAD and NSTEMI indicates a chronic condition involving the coronary arteries, which aligns with the ICD-9 code |414.8| for other specified forms of chronic ischemic heart disease.\n\nThe patient presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, and was found to have a positive blood culture from the PICC line, indicating a suspected line infection. This, combined with the administration of vancomycin for a two-week course, supports the diagnosis of bacteremia, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |790.7| for unspecified bacteremia.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions \"Venous stasis dermatitis\" and \"Chronic bilateral [lower extremity] edema,\" which are indicative of chronic venous insufficiency. These conditions suggest a long-standing issue with venous return, leading to skin changes and edema, aligning with the diagnosis of |459.81|: venous (peripheral) insufficiency, unspecified.\n\nThe patient presented with altered mental status (AMS) and dyspnea, and was found to have a positive blood culture from the PICC line, indicating a suspected line infection. This, combined with the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics such as vancomycin and the resolution of her mental status and hypercarbia after antibiotic treatment, strongly suggests a diagnosis of sepsis, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |995.91|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of tinea pedis, which is a fungal infection of the foot. This condition is specifically coded as |110.4|, indicating dermatophytosis of the foot. Therefore, the presence of tinea pedis in the patient's past medical history directly supports the assignment of the ICD code |110.4|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient had a PICC line associated with a left upper extremity DVT and hematoma, which required treatment with enoxaparin. This complication, while not a misadventure at the time of the procedure, is a later complication related to the PICC line, aligning with the ICD code |E879.8|.\n\nThe patient presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, and was found to have a high PaCO2 level of 108 on admission, indicating significant hypercarbia. This hypercarbia is a key feature of acidosis, leading to the diagnosis of |276.2| acidosis. The patient's condition improved with the use of BiPAP and diuresis, but the initial presentation and laboratory findings clearly support the presence of acidosis.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she was on a prednisone taper during her hospital stay, starting at 55 mg and gradually decreasing to 20 mg. This indicates the ongoing use of steroids, which aligns with the ICD code |V58.65| for an encounter for long-term (current) use of steroids.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8, and laboratory results consistently showing elevated creatinine levels (1.9-2.1) during the hospital stay. These findings, along with the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the discharge summary, support the assignment of the ICD-9 code |585.9| for chronic kidney disease, unspecified.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8, and upon admission, her creatinine was 2.1, indicating a slight increase. Although the note does not explicitly state hypertension, the patient's history of cardiovascular diseases such as CAD and chronic diastolic congestive heart failure suggests underlying hypertension. Therefore, the combination of hypertension and renal involvement supports the diagnosis of |403.90|, hypertensive renal disease, unspecified, without mention of renal failure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |285.9||V15.3||555.9||V58.61||414.01||428.0||412||238.75||403.90||276.7||428.32||999.32||V12.51||V10.3||999.31||530.81||782.3||414.8||790.7||459.81||995.91||110.4||E879.8||276.2||V58.65||585.9||403.90|.",

This suggests that the patient required continuous mechanical ventilation for less than 96 consecutive hours, aligning with the ICD code |96.71|.\n\nThe patient has a documented history of |571.5| cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol, as evidenced by the past medical history section stating \"Hepatitis C cirrhosis (not c/b ascites, encephalopathy, or esophageal varices).\" Additionally, the discharge diagnosis explicitly lists \"hepatic encephalopathy, hepatitis C cirrhosis,\" further confirming the presence of |571.5|.\n\nThe patient presented with acute onset confusion and left-sided weakness, which raised initial concern for a cerebrovascular event such as a stroke. However, subsequent evaluations including CT and MRI scans did not reveal any acute intracranial processes or infarcts, and the patient's neurological symptoms improved significantly with lactulose, indicating hepatic encephalopathy rather than a cerebrovascular event. Despite this, the initial presentation and concern for a stroke justify the consideration of |V12.54| for transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebral infarction without residual deficits.\n\nThe patient presented with acute onset confusion and left-sided weakness, raising initial concerns for a stroke or seizure. However, the neurological workup, including negative imaging studies and an EEG, did not support these diagnoses. Instead, the patient's symptoms significantly improved with lactulose, a treatment commonly used for hepatic encephalopathy, leading to the diagnosis of |070.44|: chronic hepatitis C with hepatic coma.\n\nThe patient has a history of |572.3| portal hypertension, as evidenced by the abdominal ultrasound showing perisplenic varices, which are a common complication of portal hypertension. Additionally, the presence of a hypoechoic lesion in the right hepatic lobe and coarse echotexture of the liver further support the diagnosis of chronic liver disease, which often leads to portal hypertension.\n\nThe patient's echocardiogram revealed a mildly dilated ascending aorta, which is noted in the imaging section of the clinical note. This finding is consistent with the diagnosis of thoracic aortic ectasia, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |447.71|. The clinical note specifically mentions that a follow-up echocardiogram is recommended to monitor this condition.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) that showed a mildly dilated ascending aorta, leading to the recommendation for a follow-up echocardiogram in a few years. This indicates the use of diagnostic ultrasound to assess the heart and its structures, which aligns with the ICD code |88.72| for diagnostic ultrasound of the heart.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a TTE with a bubble study suggesting intrapulmonary shunt, which is indicative of |573.5| hepatopulmonary syndrome. This finding was communicated to the outpatient hepatologist, and the condition was listed as a secondary diagnosis at discharge. Therefore, the presence of intrapulmonary shunt and the explicit mention of hepatopulmonary syndrome in the note support the assignment of the ICD code |573.5|.\n\nThe patient presented with acute onset confusion and left-sided weakness, raising initial concerns for stroke or seizure. However, the neurological workup, including negative imaging and EEG, did not support these diagnoses. Given the patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and the improvement in mental status with lactulose, the primary diagnosis was hepatic encephalopathy, which falls under the category of |348.39| other encephalopathy.\n\nThe patient's echocardiogram revealed a mildly dilated ascending aorta, which is noted in the imaging section of the clinical note. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of aortic ectasia, a condition characterized by the abnormal dilation of the thoracic aorta. Therefore, the target ICD code |447.70| (aortic ectasia, unspecified) is appropriately inferred from the clinical documentation.\n\nThe patient presented with acute onset confusion and left-sided weakness, initially raising concerns for stroke or seizure. However, the neurological workup, including EEG and imaging, did not reveal any acute intracranial processes or epileptic activity. Given the patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and the improvement in mental status with lactulose, the most likely diagnosis was hepatic encephalopathy, which falls under the broader category of |349.82| toxic encephalopathy.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy secondary to liver disease, with platelet counts of 37* on admission and 27* on discharge, both significantly below the normal range. These laboratory findings directly support the diagnosis of |287.5| (thrombocytopenia, unspecified).\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |96.71||571.5||V12.54||070.44||572.3||447.71||88.72||573.5||348.39||447.70||349.82||287.5|.",

This is further supported by the laboratory results showing low vitamin B12 levels (VitB12-289) and the administration of B12 supplements, reinforcing the diagnosis of B12 deficiency.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient with a history of gastric MALT lymphoma, which is a type of malignant lymphoma affecting the stomach. The diagnosis of MALT lymphoma is supported by the EUS biopsy results and the CT scan showing limited disease. Therefore, the target ICD code |202.80|, which refers to other malignant lymphomas, unspecified site, extranodal and solid organ sites, is appropriate for this patient's condition.\n\nThe patient experienced significant blood loss due to an upper GI bleed, leading to a drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, necessitating multiple blood transfusions. The clinical course indicates that the patient was resuscitated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, including 8 units of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, which suggests a state of shock secondary to hemorrhage. Therefore, the diagnosis of |785.59| (other shock without mention of trauma) is appropriate based on the patient's hemodynamic instability and the need for resuscitative measures.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of sleep apnea, specifically noted as \"Sleep apnea (no CPAP)\" under the Past Medical History section. This indicates that the patient has a documented history of sleep apnea, which aligns with the target ICD code |780.57| for unspecified sleep apnea.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes hypertension (HTN), which is mentioned without specifying the type or severity. Given this information, the appropriate ICD-9 code for this condition is |401.9|, indicating unspecified essential hypertension.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of COPD, which is documented as \"COPD\" under the Past Medical History section. This condition aligns with the ICD-9 code |496|, which describes chronic airway obstruction, not elsewhere classified. Therefore, the presence of COPD in the patient's history supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |496|.\n\nThe patient underwent a partial gastrectomy, which involves the removal of a portion of the stomach. This surgical procedure results in the acquired absence of a part of the stomach, aligning with the ICD-9 code |V45.75| for acquired absence of stomach.\n\nThe patient's clinical note describes a significant upper GI bleed, evidenced by hematemesis and melena, leading to a drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels from 28 to 13. The patient required multiple blood transfusions and eventually underwent a partial gastrectomy to manage the bleeding. These findings clearly indicate a hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal tract, supporting the assignment of the ICD-9 code |578.9|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, which is documented as \"Nephrolithiasis\" under the Past Medical History section. This indicates a personal history of urinary calculi, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V13.01|.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |266.2||202.80||785.59||780.57||401.9||496||V45.75||578.9||V13.01|.",

Therefore, the presence of hypomagnesemia in the clinical note justifies the assignment of the ICD code |275.2|.\n\nThe patient underwent an EGD which revealed a large amount of retained fluid and an ulcerated mass in the lower body of the stomach, causing partial obstruction. The biopsy results confirmed chronic active gastritis, and the EGD/EUS findings showed circumferential thickening of the gastric wall with complete obstruction, leading to the diagnosis of |537.0|: acquired hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II (|250.00|), which is mentioned in both the Past Medical History and the Discharge Diagnosis sections of the clinical note. The note also indicates that the patient was maintained on sliding scale insulin and glargine during her hospital stay, further confirming the presence of |250.00|. Additionally, the discharge medications include glargine, which is consistent with the management of type II diabetes.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of anemia, which is described as \"chronic, stable likely due to mass.\" This indicates that the anemia is associated with the underlying gastric/duodenal mass, aligning with the ICD code |285.22| for anemia in neoplastic disease. The presence of a mass causing obstruction and the chronic nature of the anemia support this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, which is documented in the Past Medical History section. This condition is consistent with hypertensive renal disease, as hypertension (HTN) is listed among her past medical conditions. Therefore, the diagnosis of |403.90| (hypertensive renal disease, unspecified, without mention of renal failure) is supported by the clinical note.\n\nThe clinical note describes an endoscopic procedure (EGD) performed to evaluate a gastric mass and duodenal mass. During the EGD, biopsies were taken from the antral and fundic mucosa, as well as from the esophagus, indicating that a closed biopsy was conducted. This aligns with the ICD code |45.16|, which specifically denotes esophagogastroduodenoscopy with closed biopsy.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that she was \"notably hypokalemic,\" and her potassium levels were low, requiring repletion. This finding directly supports the diagnosis of |276.8| (hypokalemia). Additionally, the discharge instructions include discontinuing potassium supplements and monitoring her potassium levels, further confirming the presence of hypokalemia.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent an EGD/EUS, which revealed several (___) lymph nodes in the gastro-hepatic region and celiac axis, with the largest measuring 5.8mm x 8mm. FNA (fine needle aspiration) was performed on the largest gastro-hepatic lymph node. This procedure aligns with the target ICD code |40.11|, which specifies a biopsy of a lymphatic structure.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient has a history of a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which is a type of atrial septal defect. Specifically, the note states, \"5. PFO,\" under the Past Medical History section. This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |745.5|, which refers to an ostium secundum type atrial septal defect.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, which is explicitly mentioned in the Past Medical History section. This condition is characterized by moderate renal impairment, aligning with the ICD code |585.3|. The clinical note provides supporting evidence through laboratory values and medication management, including the use of losartan and the monitoring of creatinine levels, further confirming the diagnosis of |585.3|.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent an EGD/EUS, which revealed circumferential thickening of the gastric wall with complete loss of normal gastric architecture and few pseudopodia suspicious for tumor extension beyond the muscularis layer. This detailed ultrasound evaluation of the digestive system, particularly focusing on the gastric wall and potential mass, aligns with the ICD code |88.74| for diagnostic ultrasound of the digestive system.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a mention of \"Mild aortic stenosis,\" which directly corresponds to the ICD-9 code |424.1| for aortic valve disorders. This information is explicitly stated in the clinical note, providing a clear basis for associating the patient's condition with the specified ICD code.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |275.2||537.0||250.00||285.22||403.90||45.16||276.8||40.11||745.5||585.3||88.74||424.1|.",

The patient underwent surgical repair of the incarcerated left inguinal hernia, and the obstruction was managed, aligning with the diagnosis of |550.11|: unilateral inguinal hernia with obstruction, without mention of gangrene.\n\nThe patient developed atrial flutter with variable conduction, leading to a hemodynamically stable but refractory rhythm. Due to the inability to control the rhythm chemically, the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out clots, followed by successful cardioversion, which restored normal sinus rhythm. This procedure is documented in the clinical note, justifying the assignment of the ICD-9 code |99.61| for atrial cardioversion.\n\nThe patient developed atrial flutter with variable conduction, which was likely triggered by the sympathetic response to the small bowel obstruction and subsequent surgery. This arrhythmia required intervention, including anticoagulation with warfarin and attempts at chemical cardioversion, ultimately leading to a procedure for restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Therefore, the diagnosis of |427.31| (atrial fibrillation) is supported by the clinical course and management described in the note.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is consistent with the diagnosis of |600.00|. Additionally, the patient experienced urinary difficulty during his hospital stay, including significant scrotal swelling and reported difficulty urinating, although a bladder scan showed no urinary retention. These symptoms, combined with the initiation of tamsulosin for BPH management, support the inference of |600.00|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that he developed significant scrotal swelling and reported difficulty urinating, although a bladder scan showed no urinary retention. Subsequent cultures from a grossly positive urinalysis grew *Klebsiella* and *Corynebacterium*, leading to the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI). This evidence supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |599.0| for urinary tract infection, site not specified.\n\nThe patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with closure of internal hernia during their hospital stay, as documented in the \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section and the \"Brief Hospital Course.\" This procedure specifically involved closing a hernia of the anterior abdominal wall, which aligns with the ICD code |54.62|.\n\nThe patient underwent a repair of an incarcerated left inguinal hernia using a biodegradable plug and keyhole mesh, as detailed in the surgical procedure section of the clinical note. This specific technique aligns with the description of a unilateral repair of an indirect inguinal hernia with a graft or prosthesis, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |53.05|.\n\nThe patient developed significant scrotal swelling and reported difficulty urinating, although a bladder scan showed no urinary retention. Subsequent urinalysis was grossly positive, and cultures grew *Klebsiella* and *Corynebacterium*, leading to the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI). This condition is classified under |607.89|, which covers other specified disorders of male genital organs.\n\nThe patient developed significant volume overload following his surgery, resulting in large amounts of swelling in his legs and scrotum. This condition was effectively managed with IV lasix, and he was continued on oral lasix 40 mg daily for one week at discharge. These findings and interventions are consistent with the diagnosis of |276.69|, indicating other fluid overload.\n\nThe patient underwent a repair of an incarcerated left inguinal hernia with a biodegradable plug and keyhole mesh (Lichtenstein) and later required an exploratory laparotomy with closure of the internal hernia due to persistent symptoms and a transition point of obstruction. These procedures indicate complications related to the initial surgical intervention, aligning with the ICD code |E878.8|, which describes other specified surgical operations and procedures causing abnormal patient reactions or later complications without mention of misadventure at the time of operation.\n\nThe patient underwent a repair of an incarcerated left inguinal hernia with a biodegradable plug and keyhole mesh, followed by an exploratory laparotomy with closure of the internal hernia. The clinical note indicates that the patient experienced a small-bowel obstruction due to the reduction en masse of the inguinal hernia, which is a known complication of such procedures. This sequence of events aligns with the ICD code |E870.0|, which describes a surgical operation with the formation of an external stoma causing a later complication without mention of misadventure at the time of the operation.\n\nThe patient developed atrial flutter with variable conduction, which was documented in the ECG results and required intervention.

This indicates that the patient has a personal history of |250.00|, type II diabetes mellitus, even though it is currently resolved. Therefore, the code |V12.83|, personal history of diabetes mellitus, is appropriate based on this information.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness notes a massive weight loss with a BMI reduction from 49.4 to 22.8, indicating significant improvement in her overall health and body mass. This information directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V85.4|, which denotes a body mass index between 19-24 for adults. The detailed BMI values provided in the clinical note further confirm this classification.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness mentions \"chronic constipation,\" which is a key symptom leading to the diagnosis of |564.09| (other constipation). Additionally, the past medical history reiterates this condition, providing further support for the association with the ICD code |564.09|.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness mentions a significant past medical history of hidradenitis affecting the axilla and groin areas. This directly corresponds to the diagnosis of hidradenitis, which is coded as |705.83|. Therefore, the presence of this condition in the patient's medical history justifies the assignment of the ICD-9 code |705.83|.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness mentions a significant past medical history of panic attacks and anxiety, which directly supports the diagnosis of |300.01| (panic disorder without agoraphobia). Additionally, the brief hospital course notes that the patient consistently complained of anxiety and was prescribed Xanax PRN, further reinforcing the presence of an anxiety disorder, specifically panic disorder.\n\nThe patient underwent multiple surgical procedures including panniculectomy, bilateral brachioplasty, bilateral mastopexy, and bilateral buttock and thigh lifts, which collectively address excessive skin and fat removal from various parts of the body. These procedures are consistent with size reduction plastic operations aimed at reducing the size of different anatomical areas, thus aligning with the ICD code |86.83|.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness indicates a massive weight loss, with her BMI decreasing from 49.4 to 22.8. This significant reduction in BMI suggests that her current body mass index falls within the range of 19-24, which aligns with the ICD code |V85.3|. Therefore, the code |V85.3| is appropriate for this patient based on her documented BMI.\n\nThe patient's history of massive weight loss and associated surgical procedures, along with her ongoing complaints of anxiety and fatigue, suggest underlying psychological distress. The note mentions that the patient underwent a social work consult for supposed \"depression,\" which directly supports the diagnosis of |311|: depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified. Additionally, her frequent use of Xanax and Klonopin for anxiety further indicates a complex mental health profile consistent with depressive symptoms.\n\nThe patient underwent a bilateral mastopexy as part of her major surgical procedure, which is explicitly mentioned in the clinical note under \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure.\" This procedure is performed to lift and reshape the breasts, often following significant weight loss to achieve a more symmetrical and youthful appearance. Therefore, the ICD-9 code |85.6| for mastopexy is appropriately associated with this patient's clinical note.\n\nThe patient's clinical note describes a history of massive weight loss resulting in excess skin, which is evident from the surgical procedures performed, including panniculectomy, brachioplasty, and multiple lifts. The presence of \"excess skin\" post-weight loss directly aligns with the diagnosis of |701.8|, which covers other specified hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin.\n\nThe patient underwent a panniculectomy, bilateral brachioplasty, bilateral mastopexy, bilateral buttock, and thigh lift, which collectively address issues related to excessive adiposity. These procedures were performed due to massive weight loss and the resulting excess skin, indicating a condition of localized adiposity. Therefore, the diagnosis of |278.1| (localized adiposity) is appropriate based on the surgical interventions and the patient's history of significant weight loss.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |V12.83||V85.4||564.09||705.83||300.01||86.83||V85.3||311||85.6||701.8||278.1|.",

This condition is further supported by the presence of GERD in the secondary diagnosis at discharge. Therefore, the target ICD code |530.81| is appropriately associated with the patient's clinical history.\n\nThe patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), evidenced by the past medical history noting \"bilateral renal artery stenosis\" and the laboratory results showing an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 44/54, which is indicative of stage III (moderate) CKD. Additionally, the patient experienced hypotension during the hospital stay, which required adjustments in medications like Lisinopril and Lasix, further supporting the presence of underlying |585.3|.\n\nThe patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which resulted in a spiral dissection of the right iliac artery extending to the common femoral artery, as documented in the radiology report and cardiology report. This complication occurred after the procedure and is consistent with the definition of |E879.0|, indicating a later complication without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure.\n\nThe patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), as noted in the Past Medical History section. Additionally, the echocardiogram performed during the hospital stay revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, all of which are consistent with the diagnosis of |428.0|: congestive heart failure, unspecified.\n\nThe patient has a history of rheumatic mitral valve disease with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, as documented in the echocardiography report. This condition directly corresponds to the ICD-9 code |424.0|, which encompasses mitral valve disorders. Therefore, the presence of mitral regurgitation due to rheumatic heart disease justifies the assignment of |424.0|.\n\nThe patient experienced an episode of hypotension overnight, with systolic blood pressure in the 70s while sleeping, which required a 500cc fluid bolus to raise systolic blood pressure to the 90s. This event, documented in the brief hospital course, supports the diagnosis of |458.9| (hypotension, unspecified).\n\nThe patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which resulted in a spiral dissection of the right iliac artery extending to the common femoral artery, as documented in the radiology report and cardiology report. This complication is specifically described as a dissection of the iliac artery, which aligns with the ICD-9 code |443.22|.\n\nThe patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which led to a right iliac artery dissection, as documented in the radiology report and the brief hospital course. This complication is directly related to the cardiac catheterization procedure, making the code |996.72| (other complications due to other cardiac device, implant, and graft) applicable, as it captures the procedural complication involving a blood vessel.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient who underwent a cardiac catheterization, during which a bare-metal stent was successfully placed in the distal right coronary artery (RCA) to treat a 90% distal RCA stenosis. This procedure is explicitly documented in the Cardiology Report section, confirming the insertion of one vascular stent, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |00.45|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates that she was prescribed warfarin upon discharge, as evidenced by the medication list which includes \"Warfarin 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.\" Additionally, the note mentions that the patient was bridged with Lovenox (enoxaparin) during her hospital stay to manage anticoagulation while warfarin was held for the procedure. These details support the inference of the ICD code |V58.61|, indicating an encounter for the long-term use of anticoagulants.\n\nThe patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, as noted in the Past Medical History section, and is currently on Tikosyn for failed cardioversion. Additionally, the EKG findings during the hospital stay show atrial flutter, which is closely related to atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the diagnosis of |427.31| (atrial fibrillation) is supported by both historical and current clinical evidence.\n\nThe patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which resulted in a right iliac artery dissection, as documented in the radiology report and cardiology report. This complication, while not a misadventure at the time of the procedure, is a later complication arising from the catheterization, leading to the appropriate ICD-9 code |E879.8|.\n\nThe patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which led to a right iliac artery dissection, as documented in the clinical note. This dissection was identified on imaging studies and required monitoring and management during the hospital stay. Therefore, the diagnosis of |443.29| (other dissecting aneurysm of artery of lower extremity) is appropriately coded based on the documented complication of the cardiac catheterization.\n\nThe patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease, including a 90% distal right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis. The procedure included successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and placement of a bare-metal stent in the distal RCA, which aligns with the ICD code |00.66|.\n\nThe patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was on Tikosyn for failed cardioversion, indicating a pre-existing condition of |427.32| (atrial flutter). During the hospital stay, the EKG showed atrial flutter at 81 bpm, confirming the presence of |427.32|. The treatment plan included managing her atrial flutter with medications such as Diltiazem and Dofetilide, further supporting the diagnosis of |427.32|.\n\nThe patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which involved coronary angiography to assess her coronary arteries. The procedure report indicates that the coronary angiography demonstrated two-vessel coronary artery disease, including a 90% distal RCA stenosis, which required the placement of a bare-metal stent. This detailed description of the coronary arteriography using multiple catheters aligns with the ICD code |88.56|.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension and bilateral renal artery stenosis, which are documented in the Past Medical History section. These conditions suggest the presence of hypertensive renal disease, as hypertension often leads to renal artery stenosis and subsequent renal disease. Therefore, the code |403.90| (hypertensive renal disease, unspecified, without mention of renal failure) is appropriate based on the provided clinical information.\n\nThe patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and was admitted with chest pain, leading to a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The cardiac catheterization revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease, including a 90% distal right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis, which required the placement of a bare-metal stent. These findings confirm the presence of significant atherosclerotic lesions in the native coronary arteries, supporting the assignment of the ICD-9 code |414.01| for coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness mentions a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a previous ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with stents placed in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the right coronary artery (RCA). This indicates a past myocardial infarction, which aligns with the ICD-9 code |412| for old myocardial infarction.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of |272.4| (other and unspecified hyperlipidemia) under the Past Medical History section, specifically listed as a cardiac risk factor. This indicates that the patient has a documented history of elevated lipid levels, which is consistent with the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. Therefore, the presence of this condition in the patient's medical history supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |272.4|.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient who underwent a cardiac catheterization, during which a bare-metal stent was placed in the distal right coronary artery (RCA) to address a 90% distal RCA stenosis. This procedure is clearly documented in the cardiology report, stating, \"Successful PTCA and placement of a 3.0x15mm Vision bare-metal stent were performed in the distal RCA.\" Therefore, the target ICD code |36.06|, which represents the insertion of coronary artery stent(s), is appropriately inferred from this information.\n\nThe patient presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as evidenced by elevated troponin levels (Trop T peaked at 3.12) and EKG changes showing ST depressions and T-wave inversions. These findings, along with the patient's history of coronary artery disease and the subsequent cardiac catheterization revealing significant coronary artery disease, support the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction, specifically a subendocardial infarction, leading to the ICD-9 code |410.71|.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |530.81||585.3||E879.0||428.0||424.0||458.9||443.22||996.72||00.45||V58.61||427.31||E879.8||443.29||00.66||427.32||88.56||403.90||414.01||412||272.4||36.06||410.71|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of hyperlipidemia, which is directly relevant to the target ICD code |272.4| for other and unspecified hyperlipidemia. This condition is further supported by the patient's medication regimen, which includes simvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent commonly prescribed for managing hyperlipidemia. Therefore, the presence of hyperlipidemia in the patient's past medical history and the use of simvastatin provide strong evidence for the assignment of the ICD code |272.4|.\n\nThe clinical note describes a patient who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure involving three grafts: the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) and two saphenous vein grafts to the diagonal and obtuse marginal arteries. This specific surgical intervention aligns with the ICD-9 code |36.12|, which denotes an (aorto)coronary bypass of two coronary arteries. The detailed operative note and post-operative management confirm the procedure, supporting the assignment of this code.\n\nThe patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure involving the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), as documented in the \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section and the \"Brief Hospital Course.\" This specific surgical intervention corresponds to the ICD-9 code |36.15|, which denotes a single internal mammary-coronary artery bypass.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of hypertension, which is evident in both the Past Medical History section and the Discharge Diagnosis. This consistent documentation of hypertension without specifying a particular type or severity supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |401.9| for unspecified essential hypertension.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed 40% stenosis of the mid-LAD coronary artery, leading to a diagnosis of 3-vessel coronary artery disease. This procedure, specifically the catheterization of the left heart to assess coronary artery stenosis, aligns with the ICD-9 code |37.22| for left heart cardiac catheterization.\n\nThe clinical note does not explicitly mention a history of tobacco use. However, the presence of conditions such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, which are often associated with smoking, suggests a possible history of tobacco use. Therefore, the code |V15.82| can be inferred based on the patient's medical history and risk factors.\n\nThe clinical note indicates that the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, which is a form of open heart surgery. During such procedures, extracorporeal circulation is typically used to maintain blood flow and oxygenation while the heart is stopped. Therefore, the use of extracorporeal circulation during the CABG surgery is implied, leading to the assignment of the ICD code |39.61|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and the primary reason for admission was chest pain, which led to a diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The detailed history of present illness describes exertional chest pain and significant coronary artery stenosis, confirmed by cardiac catheterization, indicating intermediate coronary syndrome |411.1|. The subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting further supports the presence of intermediate coronary syndrome due to significant coronary artery disease.\n\nThe clinical note mentions that the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed 40% stenosis of the mid-LAD coronary artery and 3-vessel coronary artery disease. This procedure, involving the assessment of the coronary arteries, aligns with the ICD-9 code |88.56|, which specifically refers to coronary arteriography using two catheters.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness and past medical history both mention |414.01| coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery, as evidenced by the 40% stenosis of the mid-LAD coronary artery found during cardiac catheterization and the subsequent diagnosis of 3-vessel coronary artery disease leading to coronary artery bypass grafting. These findings and procedures are consistent with the presence of significant atherosclerotic disease in the native coronary arteries.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |272.4||36.12||36.15||401.9||37.22||V15.82||39.61||411.1||88.56||414.01|.",

This indicates a personal history of a malignant neoplasm of the prostate, leading to the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V10.46|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of stent placement, which indicates the presence of |414.01| (coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery). This is further supported by the mention of his CAD in the chief complaint and the ongoing management with medications such as aspirin and simvastatin, which are commonly used to manage and prevent complications of coronary atherosclerosis.\n\nThe patient underwent a **right carotid endarterectomy** as documented in the \"Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure\" section and detailed in the \"Brief Hospital Course.\" This surgical intervention specifically targets the carotid artery, which is a vessel in the head and neck region, aligning with the ICD code |38.12| for endarterectomy of other vessels of head and neck.\n\nThe patient presented with two episodes of sudden onset left hand numbness and tingling, which resolved spontaneously. These symptoms are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and there is no mention of residual deficits, aligning with the diagnosis of |V12.54|. Additionally, the patient's history of significant carotid stenosis and the subsequent right carotid endarterectomy further support the association with this ICD code.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |300.00| (anxiety state, unspecified), as noted in the section detailing his psychiatric conditions. This information directly supports the assignment of the ICD code |300.00|, as it is explicitly mentioned in the clinical note.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |272.4| (other and unspecified hyperlipidemia), which is supported by the mention of \"HLD\" (hyperlipidemia) in the history of present illness and the ongoing treatment with simvastatin, a lipid-lowering medication, listed in both the admission and discharge medications.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |401.9| (unspecified essential hypertension), which is explicitly mentioned in the clinical note under the \"Past Medical History\" section. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's current medications, including aspirin and simvastatin, which are often prescribed for patients with hypertension to manage cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the presence of |401.9| is clearly justified based on the provided information.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of anxiety/depression, which suggests a history of mood disorders. Although the clinical note does not provide detailed information about the current state of the patient's depression, the presence of this condition in the past medical history supports the inference of a depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, coded as |311|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes hypothyroidism, as noted in the section detailing his medical conditions. This diagnosis is directly relevant to the target ICD code |244.9|, which represents unspecified hypothyroidism. Therefore, the presence of hypothyroidism in the patient's history justifies the assignment of the ICD code |244.9|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of stent placement, specifically noted as \"CAD s/p R coronary artery stent.\" This indicates that the patient has undergone a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure in the past, which is consistent with the ICD-9 code |V45.82|, indicating the postsurgical status of PTCA.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of spinal stenosis at L4/5, which is documented as \"spinal stenosis L4/5 x ___ years.\" This specific mention of spinal stenosis in the lumbar region directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |724.02|.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |V10.46||414.01||38.12||V12.54||300.00||272.4||401.9||311||244.9||V45.82||724.02|.",

The presence of a mechanical aortic valve replacement also suggests a complex cardiovascular history, aligning with the chronic nature of diastolic heart failure.\n\nThe patient's history includes a past medical condition of diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF), which is documented in the Past Medical History section. Although the current admission primarily focuses on symptoms related to metastatic esophageal cancer, such as refractory nausea, vomiting, and encephalopathy, the presence of dCHF in the patient's medical history supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |428.0| for congestive heart failure, unspecified.\n\nThe patient presented with significant confusion and encephalopathy, which were attributed to multiple factors including hypercalcemia, pain, and the progression of his metastatic esophageal cancer. The clinical note specifically mentions \"acute multifactorial encephalopathy; likely multifactorial toxic metabolic due to hypercalcemia, pain and progression of malignancy,\" which aligns with the diagnosis of |349.82| toxic encephalopathy.\n\nThe patient presented with refractory nausea and vomiting, which led to significant dehydration, as evidenced by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels (BUN 21*, Creat 1.3*). These laboratory findings, combined with the clinical presentation of vomiting and inability to tolerate oral fluids, strongly suggest |276.51| dehydration.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple interventions, including a coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the left main coronary artery bifurcation (LAD and ramus). This indicates that the patient has undergone a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, which is reflected in the target ICD code |V45.82|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of hypertension, which is mentioned explicitly in the clinical note under \"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY.\" This indicates that the patient has a history of essential hypertension, though the specific type is not specified. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-9 code for this condition is |401.9|, which denotes unspecified essential hypertension.\n\nThe patient presented with hypercalcemia, as evidenced by the lab result showing a calcium level of 14, which is significantly elevated. This hypercalcemia is attributed to his metastatic esophageal cancer, a known cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Therefore, the diagnosis of |275.42| hypercalcemia is appropriately coded based on these clinical findings.\n\nThe patient's history of metastatic esophageal cancer and the presence of bone metastasis, as noted in the discharge diagnosis, provide strong evidence for the ICD code |338.3|, which pertains to neoplasm-related pain. The clinical note mentions that the patient's pain in the neck, shoulders, and right hip/pelvis has been well-controlled with methadone, indicating a direct association between his cancer and the experienced pain.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple interventions, including a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). This surgical procedure is directly indicated by the ICD-9 code |V45.81|, which describes the status of a patient who has undergone aortocoronary bypass surgery.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a history of defibrillation, which suggests a prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation. This is consistent with the presence of an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) in situ, as AICDs are typically implanted to manage and prevent recurrent episodes of ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, the code |V45.02| is applicable based on the patient's history of defibrillation.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple interventions, including a coronary catheterization (CCATH) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placements. These procedures indicate the presence of significant coronary atherosclerosis, which supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |414.00| for coronary atherosclerosis of unspecified type of vessel, native or graft.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, which is documented as \"Dyslipidemia\" under the past medical history section. This condition aligns with the ICD-9 code |272.4|, which refers to other and unspecified hyperlipidemia. Therefore, the presence of dyslipidemia in the patient's history justifies the assignment of the ICD-9 code |272.4|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates a diagnosis of |783.7| (adult failure to thrive) based on several key points. The patient presented with refractory nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, leading to an inability to tolerate food and fluids, which are essential for maintaining nutritional status. Additionally, the patient exhibited significant weakness, confusion, and a decline in overall functional status, further supporting the diagnosis of adult failure to thrive.\n\nThe patient's history of present illness and past medical history clearly indicate a diagnosis of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant neoplasm of the esophagus. This is further supported by the discharge diagnosis, which lists \"metastatic esophageal cancer\" as one of the primary conditions. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-9 code for this condition is |150.9|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note indicates that he was admitted with advanced metastatic esophageal cancer and experienced significant decline in health, including refractory nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypercalcemia, and encephalopathy. Despite initial symptom management and hospice care, the patient's condition deteriorated to the point where he became intolerant of all oral intake, leading to a decision to make him comfort measures only (CMO). This shift in focus to comfort care and the subsequent death of the patient clearly align with the target ICD code |V66.7|, which denotes an encounter for palliative care.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple interventions, including a coronary catheterization (CCATH) that revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and circumflex arteries, and an 80% left main stenosis. This indicates the presence of chronic total occlusion of the coronary artery, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |414.2|.\n\nThe patient's history of metastatic esophageal cancer and the presence of bone metastasis, as noted in the discharge diagnosis, provide strong evidence for the ICD code |198.5|, which indicates a secondary malignant neoplasm of bone and bone marrow. The clinical note mentions that the patient has metastatic disease involving bones, which aligns with the definition of |198.5|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions \"failure to thrive\" and \"malnutrition, moderate\" as part of the discharge diagnosis, indicating a significant decline in physical health and nutritional status. The history of present illness also describes the patient's inability to tolerate solid foods and liquids, leading to dehydration and further exacerbation of his condition. These findings support the assignment of the ICD-9 code |263.0| for malnutrition of moderate degree.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |428.32||428.0||349.82||276.51||V45.82||401.9||275.42||338.3||V45.81||V45.02||414.00||272.4||783.7||150.9||V66.7||414.2||198.5||263.0|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient has a history of T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma and is currently undergoing treatment with pembrolizumab as part of the DFCI/HCC protocol. The clinical note mentions that pembrolizumab has been associated with anemia but not neutropenia, and the patient developed neutropenia during the hospital stay, which could be an adverse effect of the antineoplastic drug. Therefore, the target ICD code |E933.1| is applicable, indicating adverse effects from antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs in therapeutic use.\n\nThe patient has a documented history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the Past Medical History section, which states \"History of sleep apnea.\" Additionally, the discharge instructions mention the use of CPAP, indicating ongoing management of this condition. Therefore, the ICD code |327.23| for obstructive sleep apnea is appropriately assigned based on this information.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, which is explicitly mentioned in the section \"PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY.\" This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |272.4| for other and unspecified hyperlipidemia.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that he developed neutropenia during his hospital stay, specifically noting that it occurred after the administration of multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, Bactrim (PPx), and Tamiflu. This neutropenia was managed by stopping the offending antibiotics and initiating Neupogen, indicating a clear association with the use of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, the diagnosis of |288.03| (drug-induced neutropenia) is supported by the clinical course described in the note.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes |401.9| (unspecified essential hypertension), as noted in the section \"PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY.\" Although the patient is currently off antihypertensive medication, the presence of this condition in the past medical history justifies the assignment of the ICD code |401.9|.\n\nThe patient has a history of T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma and is currently undergoing treatment, including recent autologous stem cell transplantation (auto SCT) and pembrolizumab therapy. The clinical note mentions ongoing management of his lymphoma, including recent treatments and the plan to continue chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This indicates that the patient is receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy, which aligns with the ICD code |V58.11|.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of type 2 diabetes, which is evident from the past medical history section stating \"Diabetes, requiring insulin (Glargine on hold for now).\" Additionally, the discharge diagnosis lists \"type 2 diabetes\" as a secondary diagnosis. These details directly support the assignment of the ICD-9 code |250.00|, indicating type II diabetes mellitus without mention of complication or uncontrolled status.\n\nThe patient presented with a significant bifrontal headache, shaking chills, and fever up to 101.9\u00b0F, which are key symptoms of |780.60| (Fever, unspecified). Despite initial broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and supportive care, the fever persisted, leading to further diagnostic evaluations including imaging and laboratory tests. The clinical note consistently documents the presence of fever throughout the hospital stay, supporting the assignment of |780.60|.\n\nThe patient has a history of T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma and underwent an autologous stem cell transplant (Auto SCT) approximately 76 days prior to admission. The clinical note mentions that the patient is currently on a post-transplant conditioning regimen, including pembrolizumab, and is experiencing complications such as neutropenia and sinusitis. These details indicate that the patient is in a post-transplantation state, which aligns with the ICD code |996.85| for complications of bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe patient has a history of T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma (T-cell and histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma), which is a type of malignant lymphoma. The clinical note mentions extensive involvement of lymph nodes, including the left inguinal and retroperitoneal nodes, as evidenced by the CT scans and PET scans showing lymphadenopathy. This aligns with the ICD code |202.88|, which describes other malignant lymphomas involving lymph nodes of multiple sites.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions that he is currently on the DFCI/HCC protocol, specifically receiving pembrolizumab as part of his treatment for T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma. This indicates participation in a structured treatment regimen, which aligns with the code |V70.09|, as it pertains to the examination of a participant in a clinical trial for normal comparison or control in clinical research.\n\nThe patient was administered IVIg (35g) on [date] for low IgG (405), as indicated in the Brief Hospital Course section. This treatment is consistent with the administration of gamma globulin, which corresponds to the ICD-9 code |99.14|.\n\nThe patient has a history of T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma and is currently undergoing treatment, including pembrolizumab, which is an antineoplastic agent. The clinical note mentions that the patient is on day +76 post-autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and is being monitored for side effects, such as neutropenia and anemia, which are common in patients receiving antineoplastic therapy. Therefore, the presence of these conditions, particularly the neutropenia and the ongoing use of antineoplastic agents, supports the assignment of the ICD code |E933.1|, indicating adverse effects from antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs in therapeutic use.\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes and is noted to require insulin, specifically glargine, which was temporarily held due to decreased intake and lower blood sugars. The discharge medications include resuming glargine, indicating ongoing long-term use of insulin. Therefore, the encounter is appropriately coded as |V58.67| for the long-term (current) use of insulin.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of B thalassemia trait, which is synonymous with B thalassemia minor. This condition is documented in the social history section, where it is noted that both his mother and son have B thalassemia minor. Therefore, the target ICD code |282.46| is appropriately associated with the patient's clinical note.\n\nThe patient presented with a one-day history of fever, shaking chills, and a significant bifrontal headache, which raised suspicion for a respiratory infection. A CT scan of the sinuses revealed extensive paranasal sinus disease, with the left side being more involved than the right, suggesting |461.9| acute sinusitis, unspecified. The patient was treated with antibiotics and symptomatic relief, with good control of symptoms.\n\nThe patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, as noted in the discharge diagnosis and past medical history sections. The discharge labs show a low hemoglobin level (Hgb-8.4*) and hematocrit (Hct-26.1*), indicating anemia. Given the patient's diabetes, these findings support the diagnosis of |285.9| (anemia, unspecified).\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |E933.1||327.23||272.4||288.03||401.9||V58.11||250.00||780.60||996.85||202.88||V70.09||99.14||E933.1||V58.67||282.46||461.9||285.9|.",

        "ans": "## Thinking\n\nThe patient's history of present illness mentions \"crampy abd pain\" and \"nausea,\" which are common symptoms of |530.81| (esophageal reflux). Additionally, the past medical history includes |530.81| (GERD), indicating a pre-existing condition of esophageal reflux. These details support the inference of |530.81| as a relevant diagnosis.\n\nThe patient has a documented history of rheumatoid arthritis, as mentioned in the Past Medical History section, where it states \"Rheumatoid arthritis-plaquinyl and mobic/advil 6 per week.\" This clearly indicates the presence of |714.0|, supporting the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a diagnosis of sleep apnea, as noted in the section \"Past Medical History\" under item 12: \"Sleep apnea not on bipap.\" This directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |780.57| for unspecified sleep apnea.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a history of lactose intolerance, which is a form of disaccharide malabsorption characterized by the inability to digest lactose due to a lack of the enzyme lactase. This condition aligns with the ICD-9 code |271.3|, which specifically refers to intestinal disaccharidase deficiencies and disaccharide malabsorption. Therefore, the presence of lactose intolerance in the patient's medical history provides a direct link to the ICD-9 code |271.3|.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension, as noted in the Past Medical History section of the clinical note. This condition is listed without specifying whether it is benign, malignant, or unspecified. Therefore, the appropriate ICD-9 code for this condition is |401.9|, which denotes unspecified essential hypertension.\n\nThe patient's clinical note mentions a significant weight loss of 15 pounds over the past 2 months, which is documented under the History of Present Illness section. This weight loss is associated with her ongoing gastrointestinal issues, including recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and diarrhea. Therefore, the diagnosis of |783.21| (loss of weight) is appropriately inferred from the clinical information provided.\n\nThe patient presented with diarrhea and abdominal pain, and stool studies confirmed the presence of *Clostridium difficile* toxin by EIA, indicating a positive test result. This, combined with her history of recurrent *C. difficile* infections and recent completion of a course of oral vancomycin, strongly supports the diagnosis of an intestinal infection due to *Clostridium difficile* (|008.45|).\n\nThe patient's history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is explicitly mentioned in the Past Medical History section, and her current symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain are consistent with IBS. Additionally, the Brief Hospital Course notes that she continued her medications for IBS, including Bentyl and Colostipol, further supporting the diagnosis of |564.1|.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes a mention of \"Colon polyps\" under the section detailing her medical conditions, specifically noting that she has a family history of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). This information directly supports the assignment of the ICD-9 code |V12.72|, indicating a personal history of colonic polyps.\n\n## Final Response\n\nTherefore, the correct icd codes are |530.81||714.0||780.57||271.3||401.9||783.21||008.45||564.1||V12.72|.",
